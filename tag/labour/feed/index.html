										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People say you forget the pain of childbirth. &#8220;You don&#8217;t remember it,&#8221; they say, as though that&#8217;s a good thing, as though that&#8217;s consoling. About 24 hours after I had gone into labour I made a pact with myself to never forgot the horror of giving birth.  <span id="more-903"></span></p>
<p>I made a decision to remember what it&#8217;s like to feel you simply can&#8217;t do another contraction and yet have to do it again and again and again &#8211; cruel,  relentless, merciless, on and on and on for 48 hours.</p>
<h3>Re-living labour every year</h3>
<p>This time six years ago, I was in hospital waiting to see my consultant to discuss being induced.  Tomorrow is the day I took my first prostin.  The day after that I took my second and my third.  On the fourth day, I went into labour.  On the fifth day I was still in labour.  On the sixth day my son was born.</p>
<p>I re-live it every year.  And as I do I salute, with awe, our great-grandmothers and great-great-grandmothers and women today,  in some parts of the world, for whom there is more than a slim chance that death will be the outcome of their labours.</p>
<p>Each May in its fresh, lime greenness and sweet, exuberant blossoming, I remember the savage cost of new life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also remember it was worth it.</p>
