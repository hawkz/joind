<p>The love of a mother is fierce as a lion, strong as an ox and tender as a dove. It’s the love that makes the world go round, an archetypal force that brings forth the generations and connects women of all classes and cultures.</p>



<p>But do
women who have become pregnant through fertility treatment have a slightly
different relationship with their children from those who have conceived
naturally? Do the years of struggling to have a child make the love more
intense if the baby eventually arrives?</p>



<span id="more-3462"></span>



<p>And what
about pregnancy? Is that fraught with particular anxieties for women who have miscarried
many times? Is it ever possible to find a way to enjoy it?</p>



<p>We will be asking some of these questions at <a href="https://www.fertilityfest.com/">Fertility Fest 2019</a>, when I&#8217;m chairing a session, Parenting after IVF at the Barbican, London. </p>



<p>The evening will start with a performance of To the Moon and Back, a dialogue between a mother and daughter on the experience of IVF from their respective perspectives – a fertility patient and a person born as a result of reproductive science. It uncovers th intensity and complexity of being born &#8220;special&#8221;.</p>



<p>The artists, Anna Furse and Nina Klaff will join me in conversation with Ann Daniels, record-breaking polar explorer and mum of IVF triplets, and Victoria Macdonald, Channel 4’s health and social care correspondent.</p>



<p>Do IVF parents love their children differently?  I&#8217;ve no idea. But I am hoping to learn something. Do <a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/parenting-after-ivf-to-the-moon-and-back" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="join us on Friday 26 April (opens in a new tab)">join us on Friday 26 April</a> to find out. Or I will post an update and let you <g class="gr_ gr_126 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="126" data-gr-id="126">afterward</g>s.</p>
