I first started longing for a child when I was in my early 20s. The dream wasn&#8217;t fulfiled until I was in my early 40s, so there was plenty of time to yearn and imagine how it might be.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest surprise for me has been the discovery that having a baby hasn&#8217;t completely dealt with that part of me that&#8230;wants a baby.\u00a0 Five years on, I still want to be pregnant, to give birth and to breastfeed. That desire is more of a still small voice than the womb-wrenching scream that it was in my childless days, but it is there nonetheless.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Have another one,&#8221; is my first response on observing this but\u00a0 &#8211; even if I could &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s the solution. I&#8217;m guessing that even if I had five or six, I&#8217;d still end up grey-haired, saggy-bellied and wanting a baby.<\/p>\n<h3>Embrace my desire as metaphor<\/h3>\n<p>As I already have a child, I&#8217;m wondering if the desire that remains is best not taken literally. Perhaps I should welcome it as primal, as archetypal.\u00a0\u00a0 I wonder what would happen if, instead of feeling saddened that my baby-days are over, I embraced my desire as a metaphor to live by and found other ways of conceiving, bearing, giving birth.<\/p>\n<p>This is a new thought. It&#8217;s very much in embryo but I shall wait as it implants and see what grows.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For me, there have been few surprises about motherhood.
