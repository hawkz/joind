You get given a ticket for each item you bring. You have a cup of tea and when the gong strikes, you all make a modest-but-mad rush to the rails to pick up any goodies that have caught your eye on the way in. You &#8216;pay&#8217; for them with your tickets.<\/p>\n<p>The fun for me is seeing other people trying on your discarded clothes, looking great in them and going home feeling very happy. That was the unexpected bit &#8211; a pleasure you miss if you drop your clothes off at a charity shop.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a great gig for girlies &#8211; all trying things on and giving each other tips and ideas &#8211; but last time the blokes enjoyed it too. See you there.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Calling all Balsall Heath, Birmingham types.\u00a0 Come along to the next Great Green Clothes swap at Balsall Heath Church Centre, Edward Road B12 9JU on Friday 23 April at 7pm.
