					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Jo. I keep up with your progress via Anne, and occasionally read of your exploits etc...Really amazed at what you have done over the years. And as a somewhat obsessive, though slow and tubby runner, always glad to welcome anyone else on board.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Virgina-blast-from-the-past-Moffat! Fancy finding you here. And you became a writer too.  And you called your blog A Room of my Own. I called my first post A cyber-room of one&#039;s own. (https://joind.co.uk/2009/writing/a-cyber-room-of-ones-own#more-294) How strange. How nice to hear from you after 25 years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jo,

Lovely to find your website and GREAT post. I have long despised BMI for this very reason!
And I NEVER weigh myself!

Lots of love

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, I guess the BMI is well used because it&#039;s simple, low-tech and easy to promote.  But if it&#039;s misleading, doesn&#039;t it do more harm than good?  I have a very fit friend, who is constantly battling with her weight. Why? Because a nurse at her GP&#039;s took her to one side and said: &quot;I&#039;m sorry to say this, but you&#039;re obese.&quot;  My friend has been at war with her body ever since.  I want to take the system that caused the nurse to do that test and make that interpretation and smack it about the head.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s really interesting. We hear that the waist measurement is important, but not how to work out whether it&#039;s good or bad. 

I suppose the calculation has to take into account height, weight and other proportions. Which, of course, wouldn&#039;t be anywhere near as simple to explain - and, crucially, *promote* - as the simple BMI.

Good to hear you&#039;re no longer disheartened, anyway! &#039;Rah&#039; for NHS Local!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s great Laurster, so long as the scales ARE giving you information about how what you are doing is affecting your body.  I was needing to ditch them, because they were &quot;telling&quot; me that working out was making me fatter, even though my clothes and the tape measure and my friends were telling me otherwise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. Have to say it&#039;s difficult to totally ditch the scales. I spent ages trying to gauge my weight/shape purely by my trusty old jeans; if they were tight I needed to work out/go easy on the biscuits - if they were loose... actually that never happened. Anyway eventually I grew out of said jeans and find weighing myself weekly helpful to learn how what I&#039;m eating and what exercise I&#039;m doing is affecting my body.]]></description>
