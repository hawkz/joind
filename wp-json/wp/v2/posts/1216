(I would have taken photos of all of those things to show you, but the garden&#8217;s the only thing that&#8217;s ready at the moment.)<\/p>\n<p>Architect\u00a0Francine Houben calls it the &#8220;people&#8217;s palace.&#8221; I like that description but it doesn&#8217;t quite work for me because I don&#8217;t know what one does in a palace, except walk quietly down the corridors and be on one&#8217;s best behaviour.<\/p>\n<p>I prefer to think of it as the &#8220;people&#8217;s playground&#8221; &#8211; a place where you arrive and think : &#8220;Oooh, look we could play pirates over there. \u00a0 Or shall we go down here and pretend to be hobbits? But I want to play on the swings first. \u00a0Hey, look! \u00a0Let&#8217;s make a den over there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Library of Birmingham is opening soon.
