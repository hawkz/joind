										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went up to my study last week and screamed. For reasons, that perhaps only a five-year-old can understand, Arch had pulled every one of my books from my shelves and hurled them in a spine-bent, cover-ripped pile on the floor.<span id="more-785"></span></p>
<p>So that was how I came to be doing something I had not done for five years, ten years, 20 years in some cases &#8211; laying my hands upon my treasures&#8230;opening them, smelling them, remembering what I had been doing and who I had been when I had drunk deeply of their meanings.</p>
<h3>My books are familiar &#8211; yet strange</h3>
<p>But as I leafed through these layers of self, I was surprised to find strangeness and familiarity in equal measure.</p>
<p>Take <em>The Continental Philosophy Reader</em>, for example.  I remember buying that from a store in London when I was in my 20s.  I recall how excited I was to have it.</p>
<p>Good grief.  It included Claude Levi-Strauss on the <em>Structural Study of Myth</em>, Michel Foucault on <em>The Discourse of Language</em> and Hans-Georg Gadamer on <em>The Universality of the Hermeneutical Problem</em>.  Who wouldn&#8217;t have been wetting herself?</p>
<h3>I don&#8217;t understand them</h3>
<p>But as I looked through the fat and juicy tome, I realised that some 20 years on, I didn&#8217;t understand a word of it.  What ever was it all about? Did I really read that kind of thing just for the Hell of it? Today I can barely read a newspaper.</p>
<p>Yet in the margins of this inscrutable text, were my annotations showing just how much it had meant to me:  &#8220;YES!!!!&#8221; , &#8220;Cf mimesis&#8221;, &#8220;Cf Rubem Alves&#8221;, &#8220;Yes, yes, yes!&#8221; I got it once. I don&#8217;t get it now.</p>
<p>All of which caused me to ponder&#8230;where did that thinking go? Is it lost, just because I can&#8217;t remember it?  Do the things we can&#8217;t recall disappear or have they become a part of us, affecting who we are, at some level creating us, even if we can not trace them?</p>
