										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d love to take the credit for this poem but I can&#8217;t. My only credit is knowing the utterly brilliant Rosie Miles. Fans of <a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/" target="_blank">Greenbelt Festival</a>, read and enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>If heaven (2)</strong><span id="more-556"></span></p>
<p>If heaven might happen</p>
<p>it would look like a racecourse</p>
<p>full of people not horses.</p>
<p>Everyone would have a place to pitch their tent</p>
<p>and there would be lots of mud and weather.</p>
<p>We would all be the same as before</p>
<p>except our bladder functions would have dried up.</p>
<p>There would be a place</p>
<p>on the top floor of heaven</p>
<p>to be very quiet.</p>
<p>There would also be skateboarding,</p>
<p>bands playing underground where the average age is fourteen,</p>
<p>a smörgåsbord of stalls to get food.</p>
<p>The programme of What Is On In Heaven</p>
<p>would be very full.</p>
<p>There would be a soundtrack of eternal drumming.</p>
<p>The Big Drummer would slow the rhythm</p>
<p>so everyone could get the beat.</p>
<p>You would be able to sit in one corner of heaven</p>
<p>and watch the amazing wide sky.</p>
<p>In another you could listen to a man</p>
<p>speak clearly of how he fought for human rights</p>
<p>when he was alive.  You could hear</p>
<p>a politician, a priest, a poet, a shy stuttering actor,</p>
<p>a Dominican monk, a cultural commentator.</p>
<p>You could wonder what would have happened</p>
<p>&#8212; what might still happen &#8212;</p>
<p>if Jesus had come as a girl.</p>
<p>You could learn to jive or tango</p>
<p>(step, two, three, four).</p>
<p>You could do none of these things.</p>
<p>You could sit on the steps of heaven’s grandstand</p>
<p>and play monster Connect 4 with the friends</p>
<p>who helped you pitch your tent,</p>
<p>watching all the people wearing wellingtons</p>
<p>imprinted with smarties or jelly beans.</p>
<p>Ten-foot transvestite angels would waft past</p>
<p>blowing bubbles of ambient music.</p>
<p>Strangers would smile at you</p>
<p>and people would have brought their dogs.</p>
<p>There would be a Big Top and jugglers on monocycles</p>
<p>and all the people on the doors of heaven’s venues</p>
<p>checking that you were wearing heaven’s wristband</p>
<p>would be unfailingly cheerful.</p>
<p>You would marvel at their ability</p>
<p>to herd an impossible number of people</p>
<p>into a finite space.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who signal to others the end of the queue.</p>
<p>In heaven they shall be the salt of the earth.</p>
<p>And you would belong there – really belong there –</p>
<p>because heaven would not be about</p>
<p>keeping your doubt out</p>
<p>or your many questions.</p>
<p>In fact, if heaven might happen there will be</p>
<p>no certainty at all</p>
<p>just a community of the wounded</p>
<p>who are as lost as you are</p>
<p>eating churros dipped in chocolate</p>
<p>trying to sing</p>
<p>the intelligence of the heart.</p>
