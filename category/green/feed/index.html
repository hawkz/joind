					<description><![CDATA[It's creative collaboration rather than self-expression that interests me now.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It took an artist creating a paper model of Balsall Heath Park, a world-renown Imam explaining Ramadan to non-Muslims and the gifting of trees in an inner-city neighbourhood, for me to understand why I no longer write books.</p>



<span id="more-4620"></span>



<p>I am delighted to be the producer of <a href="https://www.ourgardenbalsallheath.org/">Our Garden – Sacred Spaces of Balsall Heath</a>, a project in which we are making a beautiful map showing Balsall Heath as a place of trees, bees, and blue and green spaces rather than roads. We have three brilliant artists –<a href="https://linktr.ee/ShaheenAhmedArtist">Shaheen Ahmed</a>, <a href="https://rachelpfineart.wordpress.com/">Rachel Pilkington</a> and Dave Gray – a great project manager in Abbas Shah and a steering group made up of representatives from two mosques and a church.</p>



<p>It was my idea.</p>



<p>For almost ten years I have been fantasising about creating an artists’ map showing the waterways and wildlife of Birmingham, so that, even in the UK’s second city, we can imagine ourselves as people of nature.</p>



<p>Through gathering together project partners in the form of the United Church of St Paul’s, the <a href="https://www.bahutrust.org/">Hazrat Sultan Bahu Trust</a> and the Al-Abbas Islamic Centre, all in Balsall Heath, we became a Creative City Project generously funded by Birmingham City Council programmed by the&nbsp;<a href="http://birmingham2022.com/festival/">Birmingham 2022 Festival.</a></p>



<p>Now we are forming relationships, praying together under stars, planting fruit trees and planning to make beautiful art.</p>

<p>I didn’t start my professional creative life as a producer. I started out writing books. I was aged 21, straight from university when I wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fat-Spiritual-Issue-My-Journey/dp/026467295X">Fat is a Spiritual Issue</a>, followed a decade later by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Memories-Bliss-God-Sex-Us/dp/033402885X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3A3R7I3D8LPFL&amp;keywords=memories+of+bliss&amp;qid=1650308873&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=memories+of+bliss%2Cstripbooks%2C88&amp;sr=1-1">Memories of Bliss</a>.</p>



<p>With both books, I remember the point at which I sent them off to their publishers, a point at which nobody else had read them in their entirety apart from me. Writing books was a solitary activity. I discussed the content with others, but nobody read what I had written, commented on it or steered me along the way.</p>



<p>In writing, there was an intimacy between me and the page. It was a place through which I grafted and despaired and became. When I finally got to the point where I could say: “So THAT’s what I needed to write,” it was as much of a surprise to me as it was to anyone else. The great river of creativity had carried me to a place that had been hidden even from me.</p>



<p>Having done that twice, the day came when a publisher said: “What do you want to write next? I don’t mind what it is. Tell us what you want to write and we’ll publish it.” It was an enviable offer by any standards and yet, for reasons that alluded me at the time, I found myself thinking: “Nah…”</p>



<p>Looking back, I can say I stopped writing books.</p>



<p>That brings me to today and Our Garden – Sacred Spaces of Balsall Heath. Unlike my books, which were written entirely by me, this is a project I couldn’t possibly do by myself. And that is the very thing that touches me. I go out of the room to make tea and when I come back the artists are talking about the nature map and making it their own. The project manager is forming relationships in ways that I couldn’t. The <a href="https://chamberlainhighburytrust.co.uk/">Chamberlain Highbury Trust</a> gives us fruit trees. The mosques are inviting us to Iftars I hadn’t imagined. It’s humbling. It fills me with gratitude. It’s where I want to be.</p>



<p>At the same time, I am working on <a href="https://unboxed2022.uk/">UNBOXED: Creativity in the UK</a>, a celebration of creativity taking place in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales during the summer of 2022.&nbsp; In the interests of simplicity, it calls itself a celebration of creativity, but it’s actually a particular kind of creativity that it’s celebrating &#8211; not personal self-expression but creative collaboration.&nbsp; It’s about what happens when you bring together people form science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics; what happens when you bring established organisations together with emerging artists. It’s about <em>our c</em>reativity and its power to change the world.</p>



<p>I am excited by this because this is the kind of creativity I want to experience in my life right now.</p>



<p>Am I saying that I will never write a book again? Of course not. Anything might happen.&nbsp; I can only go with the flow of the river of creativity and be surprised at where it takes me. I’m not into goals, aims and predictions.</p>



<p>But I AM saying that, when I was in young, I was very concerned with the question of what I was doing with my life. It was a question that had an urgency that drove me. Today it&#8217;s not even a question that interests me. “What are we doing together?” That&#8217;s the question that drives me now.</p>

<p>I started taking photos of Highbury Park during the 2020 lockdown, as, like many, walking became my exercise, my social life and my prayer. This image is of what I now call <a href="https://joind.co.uk/place/">Cathedral Avenue</a> &#8211; a row of lime trees that remind me of a nave.</p>



<span id="more-4517"></span>



<p>It&#8217;s a very simple idea &#8211; taking photographs from the same spot through the seasons (and not an original one either). But I have found it more profound than I had anticipated.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Highbury-Park-composite-scaled.jpg" rel="lightbox[4517]"><img decoding="async" width="2560" height="1249" src="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Highbury-Park-composite-scaled.jpg" alt="A beautiful avenue of lime trees in Highbury Park, Birmingham taken in spring, summer, autumn and winter." class="wp-image-4518" srcset="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Highbury-Park-composite-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Highbury-Park-composite-300x146.jpg 300w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Highbury-Park-composite-700x341.jpg 700w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Highbury-Park-composite-768x375.jpg 768w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Highbury-Park-composite-1536x749.jpg 1536w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Highbury-Park-composite-2048x999.jpg 2048w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Highbury-Park-composite-800x390.jpg 800w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Highbury-Park-composite-1200x585.jpg 1200w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Highbury-Park-composite-1400x683.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption>Cathedral Avenue in Highbury Park, Birmingham</figcaption></figure>



<p>It reminds me that life is always changing. To live well is therefore to allow life to flow through you like a river, rather than try to hold onto the good times as though they can last. It teaches me that death and loss are as much a part of life as buds and blossom.  It shows me that winter is as beautiful as summer and autumn as lovely as spring. So when I go through my times of grief &#8211; as I most surely have and most surely will again &#8211; I can welcome them.</p>



<p>Sometimes, I think this is all we need to know, just this &#8211; just what the trees through the seasons can tell us. If we understood this deeply, we would be most fully alive.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-weight: 600; letter-spacing: 3px; text-transform: uppercase;">HOME AS PLACE</span></div>
<p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">The summer house in our garden has become my writing place. &nbsp;At one time, I used to write in the study, our converted loft, but not anymore. &nbsp;The coronavirus lockdown means school is no longer a place but a series of emails. Consequently, the loft has been taken over. It has become the classroom and music room (and place for the Xbox, natch) while I have moved to the wooden shed at the bottom of the garden.</p>
<p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">As I sit in my summer house, the blackbirds and wood pigeons are singing. I can hear children playing from somewhere in the mid-distance &#8211; between number 56 and 68, I would guess. Sometimes I hear a violin from number 72. Weeks ago, there would have been ambulance sirens, but those come less often now. I look back at our terraced house, through the fruit trees, over my son’s goal post and the homes of our neighbours snuggled down the street.</p>
<p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">This is my place. &nbsp;And it has changed during lockdown. Our road now has a WhatsApp group which means I know food has been collected from our doorsteps and taken to the foodbank. Shopping has been dropped off at the homes of the sick. Plants have been shared and libraries of books have been left on the little brick walls outside our houses. Now, when I look down our street, I don’t just see a row of terraced houses, I see kindness.</p>
<p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">This is my place and I notice that, in many ways, my place has shrunk. I used to think of Kings Heath, with it rows of terraced houses and useful shops, as the outer edge of the neighbouring suburb of Moseley, where my son went to school and whose U15s cricket team I manage.&nbsp; There was never a day when I didn’t go into Moseley and so I felt as though I lived in Moseley/Kings Heath. But those days seem a long time ago and Moseley seems like somewhere else. My place is smaller now.</p>
<p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">Even the High Street seems some distance away. &nbsp;I’m sure Asda, Smith’s and Wilko are still there, but I haven’t walked eastward and seen them for weeks. Each day in lockdown, I have walked west. I have taken my sadness, my peace, my worry or my joy to the trees; to Kings Heath Park with the oaks and poplars and silver birch. And I have walked down the lane, scented with cow parsley, to the neighboring park of Highbury. I have seen it change from the pink of April to the blue of May and the yellow of June. I have found an avenue lined with lime trees, like a nave in nature’s cathedral. Each day I have walked down that aisle saying Mary Oliver’s words “I am a bride married to amazement” in renewed wonder at the beauty just yards from my door.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So now, as I sit in my summer house, I no longer imagine my home as a place near the number 50 bus stop. My home is in a village on the edge of a meadow. It’s down from the wood, across the way from the pond where ducklings hatch and marsh irises bloom.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Church as place</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Church used to be a place. We have all known since Sunday school that the church is the people, not the building. But the fact that the people only ever met in a building meant the whenever we talked about “going to church” we meant going to that place with a steeple or a bell. Not anymore. Our building opens once a week on a Thursday for the food bank. Otherwise, those that can &#8211; which I’m painfully aware isn’t everyone &#8211; meet through Zoom.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>To my surprise, it works. In amongst the glitches and freezes and struggles with mute, we manage to pray. We can’t sing together. Even saying the grace together is tricky. Yet somehow that doesn’t detract from the simple experience of being a people together in prayer.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In many ways being released of “place” has made thing easier. For the past four years or so, we haven’t had a regular vicar, so we have exhausted ourselves either finding a stand-in priest (so we can have communion) or devising a service ourselves as the next best thing. Without a place, we can’t meet for communion anyway &#8211; so that sorts out the need for a priest at a stroke.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It sorts out another problem too. We are actually two churches that came together because the church can no longer afford to have a priest in every parish. The two congregations have tried to hold joint services but in practice, because the services have been in either one building or the other, one congregation has always been host and the other guest. By removing “place” we have been able to meet for the first time on equal terms.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>All of which makes me wonder if we’d be better off without a building. Can we be a people without a place?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There are no easy answers to that one. The community has been formed through place &#8211; through the parishes and the buildings that stand proudly in each one. At the start of lockdown, I drove down to our church building in Balsall Heath with a boot load of food for the foodbank. There was Ivor tending the garden, Ann at the door with her apron on and Theo, my Godson, loading a trolley with food. How I had missed them! I missed them because they are amongst those who can’t join us on Zoom. I missed those ways of being together that are about tea and welcome rather than words. I missed the place because that’s where we feed the hungry, say farewell to the souls of the departed and share the seasons of our lives through song.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If we want to do those things &#8211; which we do &#8211; then having a place helps. But in the effort to maintain a place, with the history of expectation that goes with it, we lose our simplicity. Instead of serving us, our buildings become heavy weights of policy, finance and quotes for leaking roofs. I have no idea when we will return to our place or how I will feel when that happens, but I guess it won’t be like sinking back into a comfy chair. The affection for the organ, the sanctuary and bread and wine upon the altar, will be underpinned by a disturbing question. In holding onto our place, have we lost something more precious along the way?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Work as place</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For the past 18 months, I have felt ambivalent about my place of work &#8211; London. I work for ScreenSkills, an organisation with goals dear to my heart, not least because it opens up careers in the screen industries to those who have been excluded in the past.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Even so, on my train rides down to London, I would look back with nostalgia at my home city of Birmingham. I would remember the days when I worked in the West Midlands as a journalist, combing through the region and crafting its stories. I would look wistfully on the days when I was an ambassador for Birmingham’s beautiful library, worked alongside the Grand Union Canal, or listened to the waves of protestors from an office in Victoria Square. I mourned the sense of belonging I had enjoyed through working in the heart of Birmingham for more than two decades.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For the past three months, I have imagined the city centre as still. I have assumed that stillness was either eerie or tranquil, depending on your point of view. I have imagined a thick quiet in the air where once there was the clacking of heels crisscrossing Pigeon Park and dodgem-style bumps of shoppers in the Bull Ring. (Like, I said, I’m guessing). In a way, there’s nothing for me to mourn anymore, because that hubbub of activity to which I once belonged, is no longer there. ScreenSkills, too, is of no fixed abode. We have a conceptual abode &#8211; a memory, an address that’s listed on Google and with the Charity Commission. But the daily reality is that we’re a community of people united by cloud, through purpose, not place.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In many ways, I like work better. We have an all-staff meeting each Friday, over Zoom, where we play games and hang out in breakout rooms. I no longer feel like a person commuting in from the regions but an equal member of the team. &nbsp;We ask the question: “Do we even need a place?” (No answers yet.) And while we’re asking that, I know that Birmingham-based businesses are asking the same.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So what happens when work is about purpose not place? What happens to cities where that work once took place? &nbsp;Will those who worked in offices ever return? And if we won’t, what will happen to our city centres? Will they become places of leisure more than industry? A place we go to change buses, try on clothes and go to the theatre, rather than hang out with colleagues in the nine to five? And if that happens, what will happen to the buildings? What will happen to the coffee houses that service them? If council meetings no longer need a council chamber, will there still be protests in Victoria Square?&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As I reflect upon this, my picture of a city starts to change.&nbsp; Once if you named a place like, “Birmingham” or “Manchester” I would picture the centre with suburbs around it. &nbsp;Now, when I imagine Birmingham, I begin to think of a series or neighborhoods, linked like a web rather than connecting to a place with middle. &nbsp;And where once I used to think of goods and services as “made in Birmingham”, now I picture their origin in homes &#8211; homes that could be anywhere. &nbsp;With some sadness, I see my city as its residential streets rather than the industry that was once at its core.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Place and belonging</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And so, as I sit in my place at the bottom of the garden, watching the spring equinox slowly turning into the summer solstice, I notice that my inner world is turning as the places turn around me.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Places are guardians of our memories. They are our photograph albums, the soundtracks of our lives. When our places change, our connection changes with them. Being displaced has changed my imagination around my home, my church and my Birmingham and so my sense of belonging is changing too.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of those changes are sweet, like the fur lining of a winter coat. Others are quite disturbing. Comfortable or not, there is nothing to be done, except resist the temptation to hold onto the old ways of belonging or grasp prematurely for new ones. The old places and my attachments to them must fall away. The new belongings will come. They will come. They will surely come. I learnt this from the trees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve recently discovered where I live &#8211; in the countryside in the heart of Birmingham.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For around the past thirty years, I’ve been aware that I live in a city, the second largest metropolis in the UK to be precise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought I was surrounded by buildings (mainly ugly ones), a spaghetti of junctions and a blast of cars. I just saw miles and miles of hideous sprawl wherever I happened to be.</span><span id="more-3182"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in recent years, my perception has changed. I haven’t moved city. I  haven’t even moved house. But now I feel that I live amongst fields, trees, wildlife and glorious sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week the BBC published an article: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41901294" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How much of your area is built on?</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was reporting on the <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/COR0-landcover/#parent-fieldname-title" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Co-ordination of Information on the Environment (Corine) </a>project initiated by the European Commission in 1985 which found only six per cent of the UK is actually built on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A whopping 21 per cent of Birmingham is classed as ‘green urban’ &#8211; namely parks, gardens and sports fields. The map shows that where I live is indeed very green.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point made by journalist Mark Easton in his blog <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41901297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Five mind-blowing facts about what the UK looks like</a>, is that our perception of our nations is at odds with the reality &#8211; a mere 0.1 per cent of the UK is classed as &#8216;continuous urban fabric&#8217;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My sense of where I live has evolved gradually over the years through small changes in my practice. I walk through parks to get to church rather than catch the bus. And I’ve discovered <a href="https://joind.co.uk/secret-fields-birmingham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the secret fields of Birmingham</a> through taking my son to football matches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve also cultivated the habit of looking at the sky.  When I walk down the street, I choose to look up, notice the sun or the moon and remember I’m standing on a beautiful sphere that’s circling other spheres. It’s an awareness that’s always available but helped just by glancing skyward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when I&#8217;m out and about in my city, instead of being conscious of buildings (mainly ugly), cars and roads, I see myself in a field with trees,  birds, flowers, gardens and an ever-changing sky.  It just so happens that my little bit is paved. That’s all.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never imagined &nbsp;my son&#8217;s passion for football would transform my understanding of Birmingham &#8211; but that is exactly what has happened.<span id="more-1477"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">My boy is part of a football team and plays matches against other teams throughout the south of the city.</span><br style="color: #222222;"><br style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #222222;">That means that each week, I drive through the streets in search of the place where the match is being held and find myself down unknown cul de sacs or on familiar A roads in front of a previously unnoticed gateway.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222;">And there I invariably find a&nbsp;big beautiful&nbsp;open space of which I had previously been unaware.</span></p>
<h3>I think of Birmingham in a different way</h3>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">This has happened so many times that I now think of south Birmingham in a different way. &nbsp;On the surface there are roads, roundabouts, offices, houses and towerblocks. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a city of concrete and tarmac and glass facades.</span><br style="color: #222222;"><br style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #222222;">But get out of your car and walk down a tow path or through a narrow gate and you&#8217;ll find another layer to Birmingham. &nbsp;There are wide green fields, canals, wildlife, woodlands and rivers.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222;">It&#8217;s all there, nestling&nbsp;around&nbsp;the ring roads like a majestic, dignified secret.</span></p>
