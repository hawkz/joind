					<description><![CDATA[My goodness, how shocking - Nick. Nothing like a bit of anger to over-ride nostalgia.  

Great blog too.  I enjoyed your last Sunday Roast and would have left a comment but it seemed I had to sign up to Myspace to do so.

Thanks for visiting me here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When my eldest (now 20) started nursery at 3, I fled home, hid under the covers and stayed there until it was time to pick him up. On arriving at the Nursery, I was greated by a harassed looking Nursery Teacher who asked a question I will never forget. &#039;Does he HAVE a behaviour problem?&#039;

It&#039;s amazing how a few small words can bring you back to earth with a bump.
