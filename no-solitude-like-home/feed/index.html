					<description><![CDATA[I really liked your poem. I am a home body at heart and a couple of business trips took me away for a month each.

I need my alone time, so went for long walks, but was really happy to get back home, to the quiet, my own things I enjoy, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A deep and introspective post, Jo. Solitude. Peace. Tranquility. Safety. Makes one realize the importance of others and how we need them in our lives. Thanks for the realization.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jo Ind like your post! There&#039;s really no solitude like home. I don&#039;t have a baby yet and I really can&#039;t relate with the other comments but I like to share that the peace of mind I have at home is incomparable to any other place. At home, I&#039;m with my family whom I know will protect me as long as they could.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your comment, Amelia - you don&#039;t need me to tell you that I totally empathise.  That sitting quietly without so much as the radio on, isn&#039;t classed as anything.  It&#039;s not &quot;productive.&quot;  It&#039;s not something to tick off a &quot;to do&quot; list.  And yet it&#039;s essential.  

I also empathise with the ambivalence - both missing your baby and yet desperately needing time on your own.  I still feel that, even four years on.

Really good luck with that transition back into work - it&#039;s a big one.  I hope it goes well and that you manage (somehow) to find a way of integrating some quiet time into an impossibly busy life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the first day I&#039;ve had at home alone since having my baby 9 months ago. I go back to work on Monday and she&#039;s practising being at the childminder&#039;s.

I had a huge list of things to do with today&#039;s freedom but I just want to sit in the quiet. Not even Radio 4 is on!

(childminder juts rung - baby not settling so is being dropped off to me at 1pm. Half excited to see baby and half disappointed won&#039;t have more hours to myself...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Alia. In fact I think it&#039;s an essential component of creativity. But for the past four years, I have only been able find solitude by going out of the house.  Solitude in Starbucks just isn&#039;t the same as solitude at home. Here&#039;s to our creativity!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is a very good and very important point. Thank you for reminding me of the harsh and stark reality of too much solitude for many. I shall appreciate my solitude even more now I&#039;m aware of how important it is to have it in the right quantity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm. I can see the attraction of home as refuge after a heavy day, buyt to be honest, I get too much solitude. Waking up in an empty bed and eating on your own day after day isn&#039;t healthy. I look at the elderly people on the dialysis unit and suspect they&#039;re better off socially than those elderly people healthier than they but wqho rarely get out of the house or talk to anybody.]]></description>
