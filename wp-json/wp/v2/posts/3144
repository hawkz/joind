A call from work. An engrossing thought. A resentment of the 3.30pm curfew that cut across productive afternoons.<\/p>\n<p>Other times I would gaze at you on the road ahead and feel again that first amazement: \u201cAre you really my son? Are you really my boy?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Each day would bring a different conversation, each day a different mood. But the route was well-trodden and the rituals were clear: hiding in the wasteland, crossing with the lolly-pop man, looking for the ice cream van, climbing along the handrail by the neighbourhood office, walking along the Silver Street wall&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>One day, amongst the demands of work and requests to play with friends, we walked home together for the last time. When that day was, I cannot say but today is your last day at primary school so that day has passed, for sure.<\/p>\n<p>And so I grieve. I mourn the interruption: the gazing, the scooting and the dwardling. I feel the loss of the small, repeated acts of ordinariness &#8211; the 10p sweets and muddle of bags.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for the school run, my son. Celebrate. Enjoy. Take pride in growing up. And please also know that whatever your day, someone is waiting for you. Wherever you play, there\u2019s someone who delights in you. However you meander, you\u2019re being brought safely home.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes it really was a run &#8211; down School Road once the morning bell had gone, up School Road as you raced back with your friends.
