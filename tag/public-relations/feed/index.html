										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t hate the public relations industry and I certainly don&#8217;t hate people who work in it. Some of my best friends&#8230;..(<a href="http://www.jaynehowarth.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Jayne Howarth</a>, Ros Dodd etc). Unlike some journalists I actually feel grateful to good PR firms. Let&#8217;s be honest, in recent years working on a newspaper would have been far harder without them.<span id="more-403"></span></p>
<h3>What I hate is doing PR. That&#8217;s all.</h3>
<p>I feel the need to say this because since I&#8217;ve been a self-employed writer, at least once a week I get a call from somone I&#8217;ve featured in the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/" target="_blank">Birmingham Post</a> in the past, who wants me to write about them again. They suppose that now I&#8217;m freelance I&#8217;m only to happy to tout my work round a range of publications and, they imagine, earn a multiple fee from them.</p>
<p>To which I can only say that I would sooner pickle my head. In fact I DID say exactly that to one hopeful &#8211; he still didn&#8217;t understand I didn&#8217;t want the job.</p>
<p>For those that don&#8217;t understand the difference let me explain. It&#8217;s about the difference between telling and selling. I love the telling. I&#8217;m a writer. I like to communicate, to connect, to build up relationships. I loathe the selling &#8211; picking up a phone and saying: &#8216;I&#8217;ve got a great story here. Do you want to publish it?&#8217;</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not in PR. It&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not in double-glazing.</h3>
<p>Granted, there is middleground between telling and selling, a place where sales-patter and headline-writing sit. I&#8217;m comfortable on one side of that middleground, I&#8217;m not on the other.</p>
<p>Next time I&#8217;m approached by someone who wants me to both tell and sell their story, I shall put analogies about pickling heads to one side. I shall simply say: &#8216;The service you require is public relations. Â£1,500 would be the going commerical rate.&#8217; Let&#8217;s see if that works.</p>
