										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am still recovering from <a href="http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Plantar-Fasciitis.htm">plantar fasciitis</a>, a strain on my right heel brought about because my determination to run has been greater than my willingness to listen to my body.</p>
<p>I have come to understand there is something that is more of a challenge than getting fit &#8211; it&#8217;s how to be happy when you can&#8217;t.  <span id="more-874"></span></p>
<h3>Trying to recover from plantar fasciitis</h3>
<p>When I realised my plantar fasciitis was brought about by morning spurts around the park, I didn&#8217;t run for two months (I swam instead) in the hope that rest would get me better. This has worked to some extent but not completely.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;m trying a different tack.  I&#8217;m doing exercises to help my heel every day and trying to ease myself back into running kilometre by gentle kilometre.</p>
<p>And doesn&#8217;t it feel good? Doesn&#8217;t it feel great to be out in my running shoes again? To be getting fitter rather than slobbier? To be toning-up rather than filling-out? To be moving in the direction of a solid, firm torso rather than a wobbly blob blancmanged at the end of the sofa?</p>
<h3>Getting fit is easy &#8211; it&#8217;s resting that&#8217;s hard</h3>
<p>And that is my point:  getting fit is the easy bit. All it requires is a bit of will-power. If we decide that is what we want to do, most of us can do it.</p>
<p>But my aspirations are deeper. I want to learn to be as happy when I am recovering from a running injury as I am when I am getting fitter.</p>
<p>I want to embrace the whole of life and life involves being tired, being ill, being old and being injured.</p>
<h3>How to be happy when you are becoming a wobbly blob</h3>
<p>Even if I were to run a marathon, what would I do when I had done it?  No one can&#8217;t get fitter indefinitely. The time has to come when I am becoming less strong and becoming what I (in my fear) perceive as a wobbly blob.</p>
<p>My challenge is this &#8211; to be happy when I&#8217;m moving in that direction too. Unless I can crack that,  I&#8217;m only living half a life &#8211; and the easy half at that.</p>
