										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have had three personal trainers in the past five years &#8211; all young, all men and all so lean you would use a vat of olive oil should you ever need to fry them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve liked them all, and I&#8217;ve learnt different things from each.<span id="more-857"></span></p>
<p>But as I nurse a running injury I&#8217;m thinking about what I need in order to be able to run without doing as much harm as I do good.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s got me onto imagining what I really want my personal trainer to be.</p>
<p>My ideal personal trainer would be someone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaks the language of sleep and rest as eloquently as he talks of exertion</li>
<li>Understands that a woman&#8217;s strength waxes and wanes with the moon</li>
<li>Is as skilled in the fine art of listening to the body as he is in pushing it</li>
<li>Appreciates that a body in winter has different needs from a body in summer</li>
<li>Grasps that time spent exercising is time that would otherwise be spent earning money or being with the family and so needs to be kept in balance</li>
<li>Knows nothing in nature goes on getting fitter and stronger&#8230;but goes in cycles of fattening and leaning, of working and resting, of hurting and healing.</li>
</ul>
<div>Hmmm&#8230;.Looks like I&#8217;m going to have to do the job myself then.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
