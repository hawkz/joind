And conversely, when you are inside the building, you can relate what you are experiencing to what you have seen from the ground.<\/p>\n<p>Take the ironwork around the outside, as an example. I think it works brilliantly from the outside, gleaming in the sun, relating to Birmingham&#8217;s industrial heritage and speaking to me of its jewellery-making present and past.<\/p>\n<p>The surprise for me was seeing that motif, that I had assumed was for the benefit of the exterior, working so well from the inside. I think it brings a sense of drama to spaces when \u00a0you are inside. It helps you feel contained amongst the expanses of glass and frames the views in interesting ways.<\/p>\n<p>I love the Library of Birmingham from the outside. I am very excited by it from the inside too but most of all I like the interplay between the two.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0<strong>I am a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.libraryofbirmingham.com\/lobfaces\" target=\"_blank\">Face of the Library of Birmingham<\/a>\u00a0and one of its Ambassadors.
