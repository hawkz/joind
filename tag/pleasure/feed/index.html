										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PLEASURE</strong>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it, I&#8217;ve said it.</p>
<p>I was leading a workshop for Birmingham Book Festival last weekend called Finding Your Blogging Voice. One of the first things we did was brainstorm our reasons for blogging. Between us we said:<span id="more-601"></span></p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
<li>to have a voice</li>
<li>to showcase work</li>
<li>to create an archive of material</li>
<li>to explain a business</li>
<li>to connect with people</li>
<li>to improve SEO.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was leading the workshop and so I forgot to say that, though I do indeed get all those benefits from blogging, my number one reason for going tap, tap, tap is because I enjoy it.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of different pleasures, of course.</p>
<h3>Blogging isn&#8217;t like sex</h3>
<p>The pleasure of blogging isn&#8217;t like that of sex or swimming or lying on the sofa with a glass of wine. It&#8217;s  more like the pleasure of making a photo album &#8211; but using word-pictures rather than images.</p>
<p>And, <a href="https://joind.co.uk/virginia-woolf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I said when I created this website,</a> it&#8217;s like the pleasure of having my own room and getting it just how I want &#8211; my own little bit of cyberpace where I can play and muse and hang out with my friends.</p>
<p>In her seminal post <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/06/13/megnut.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What We&#8217;re Doing When We Blog,</a> Meg Hourian talks about the anatomy of a post and the communication evolution etc.  It&#8217;s all good stuff.</p>
<p>But she doesn&#8217;t say: &#8220;Having fun.&#8221;  That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing when I blog and the day it stops being enjoyable, is the day I&#8217;ll stop blogging.</p>
