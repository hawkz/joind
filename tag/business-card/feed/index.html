										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I announced in my last post that I&#8217;d got a <a href="https://joind.co.uk/nhs-business-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new business card</a>  &#8211; deputy site editor of NHS local &#8211; I made a mistake.</p>
<p>Do you know that feeling of having told a half-truth? It&#8217;s not about telling a lie. It&#8217;s about settling for less than the truth deserves, neglecting to tell the most important part of a story.<span id="more-517"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card.jpg" rel="lightbox[517]"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1681 size-medium" src="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card-300x165.jpg" alt="Jo Ind's business cards" width="300" height="165" srcset="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card-300x165.jpg 300w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card-508x280.jpg 508w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The truth &#8211; the full truth &#8211; is that many months before I had an NHS local business card, I had another one beautifully designed by lower case design, which said: &#8220;Jo Ind &#8211; Writer&#8221; on it.</p>
<p>When I left the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birmingham Post</a> and <a href="https://joind.co.uk/quitting-birmingham-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became self-employed earlier this year</a>, I was asking myself who I am and what I do.</p>
<p>I could have tried to sell myself as a journalist, editor, teacher, manager, consultant, social-media-thingy because I am all of those things but it seemed to me that what I am, at heart, is a writer. Everything else I do comes out of that.</p>
<p>That was the simple  &#8211; and deeply truthful &#8211; message that I put on my business cards.</p>
<p>But for some reason I didn&#8217;t share that at the time. I shared my position at <a href="http://www.mavericktv.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maverick TV </a>instead.</p>
<p>Well, I am deputy site editor with NHS local and do you know what? I thoroughly enjoy it.</p>
<p>But before that I was a writer. And when I am old and grey (perhaps I should say older and greyer) I will still be writer.</p>
<p>That is what I am and that is what I need to say.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>(Clearly I&#8217;m not a photographer. But I&#8217;m getting Photoshop next week, so I hope to learn how to improve the images on my blog very soon.)</p>
