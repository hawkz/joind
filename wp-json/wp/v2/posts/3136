Taking care of people\u2019s feelings and helping them feel good is what you do and who you are and what you always have been&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230;and then you have a daughter whose brain is wired in a way that means empathy does not come naturally to her. She tends to blurt out exactly what she thinks and isn\u2019t able to understand that it\u2019s hurtful, not to say shocking, to be on the receiving end of her comments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One reason why this situation is difficult for the mum is that it challenges her identity. Can she continue to think of herself as an empathetic person when she has a daughter who isn\u2019t? \u00a0How can she have faith and confidence in her daughter, as a mother surely needs to do, when her own sense of self is built on her belief that she doesn\u2019t hurt other people &#8211; and that matters?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A father who is passionate about rugby might have a similar difficulty if he has a son who hates sport and who feels &#8211; and looks &#8211; clumsy in his body. If the dad has developed his own sense of masculinity through being a flanker on the rugby pitch, his son challenges him to recognise there are other ways of being a man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time and time again, I find being a parent causes me to question the ideas I have about myself. Did I really take such pride in getting full marks in spelling tests? \u00a0Is my identity rooted in something as flimsy as that? \u00a0It would seem that is. Why else do I feel uneasy if my child doesn\u2019t do the same?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all emerge into adulthood with stories that we tell ourselves about who we are &#8211; clever, middle-class, well-liked, sporty, funny, musical, whatever&#8230;. \u00a0And these stories are important. They give us confidence and a way of navigating the world of work into which we thrust our adult selves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if we have kids who aren\u2019t well-liked or sporty or whatever our particular thing is, it raises a question. How would we have survived without that story from which our identity was formed?<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a deep question.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And it\u2019s what we\u2019re all exploring as we chatter away about whether what school our child is going to, whether our daughter is gifted and talented, whether our son has special needs..<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many of the conversations I have at the school gates, on football touchlines or in cricket pavilions are really conversations about identity.
