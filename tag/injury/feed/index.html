										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are  seven reasons why I have been just lovin&#8217; this soggy summer.</p>
<p>1) The knowledge that the reservoirs have been re-stocked and the ground is rich and moist makes me feel safe and replete.<span id="more-936"></span></p>
<p>2) In the fleeting moments when the sun DOES shine, the grass is all the more verdant, the colours deliciously intense.</p>
<p>3) I can&#8217;t run at the moment because &#8211; seven months on &#8211; I&#8217;m still recovering from an injury.  The rain makes this a tiny bit less frustrating.</p>
<p>4) Due to that same running injury, there is only one pair of shoes I can wear at this point in time &#8211; and those shoes require socks. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s chilly.</p>
<p>5) I had vowed to make progress in my garden this summer but &#8211; as ever &#8211; haven&#8217;t had time. I feel all this rain kinda lets me off that one.</p>
<p>6) Sports Day was cancelled.</p>
<p>7) I am at a stage in life when I feel sad and full of grief.  The rain has made me feel that the world is weeping with me.</p>

<p>For copyright reasons I can&#8217;t quote it all, but there is a line that brings strength as I come to terms with leading a life that is slower than I would wish: <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43333" target="_blank">I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow</a>.</p>

<p>Go slowly, friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am still recovering from <a href="http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Plantar-Fasciitis.htm">plantar fasciitis</a>, a strain on my right heel brought about because my determination to run has been greater than my willingness to listen to my body.</p>
<p>I have come to understand there is something that is more of a challenge than getting fit &#8211; it&#8217;s how to be happy when you can&#8217;t.  <span id="more-874"></span></p>
<h3>Trying to recover from plantar fasciitis</h3>
<p>When I realised my plantar fasciitis was brought about by morning spurts around the park, I didn&#8217;t run for two months (I swam instead) in the hope that rest would get me better. This has worked to some extent but not completely.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;m trying a different tack.  I&#8217;m doing exercises to help my heel every day and trying to ease myself back into running kilometre by gentle kilometre.</p>
<p>And doesn&#8217;t it feel good? Doesn&#8217;t it feel great to be out in my running shoes again? To be getting fitter rather than slobbier? To be toning-up rather than filling-out? To be moving in the direction of a solid, firm torso rather than a wobbly blob blancmanged at the end of the sofa?</p>
<h3>Getting fit is easy &#8211; it&#8217;s resting that&#8217;s hard</h3>
<p>And that is my point:  getting fit is the easy bit. All it requires is a bit of will-power. If we decide that is what we want to do, most of us can do it.</p>
<p>But my aspirations are deeper. I want to learn to be as happy when I am recovering from a running injury as I am when I am getting fitter.</p>
<p>I want to embrace the whole of life and life involves being tired, being ill, being old and being injured.</p>
<h3>How to be happy when you are becoming a wobbly blob</h3>
<p>Even if I were to run a marathon, what would I do when I had done it?  No one can&#8217;t get fitter indefinitely. The time has to come when I am becoming less strong and becoming what I (in my fear) perceive as a wobbly blob.</p>
<p>My challenge is this &#8211; to be happy when I&#8217;m moving in that direction too. Unless I can crack that,  I&#8217;m only living half a life &#8211; and the easy half at that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have had three personal trainers in the past five years &#8211; all young, all men and all so lean you would use a vat of olive oil should you ever need to fry them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve liked them all, and I&#8217;ve learnt different things from each.<span id="more-857"></span></p>
<p>But as I nurse a running injury I&#8217;m thinking about what I need in order to be able to run without doing as much harm as I do good.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s got me onto imagining what I really want my personal trainer to be.</p>
<p>My ideal personal trainer would be someone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaks the language of sleep and rest as eloquently as he talks of exertion</li>
<li>Understands that a woman&#8217;s strength waxes and wanes with the moon</li>
<li>Is as skilled in the fine art of listening to the body as he is in pushing it</li>
<li>Appreciates that a body in winter has different needs from a body in summer</li>
<li>Grasps that time spent exercising is time that would otherwise be spent earning money or being with the family and so needs to be kept in balance</li>
<li>Knows nothing in nature goes on getting fitter and stronger&#8230;but goes in cycles of fattening and leaning, of working and resting, of hurting and healing.</li>
</ul>
<div>Hmmm&#8230;.Looks like I&#8217;m going to have to do the job myself then.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
