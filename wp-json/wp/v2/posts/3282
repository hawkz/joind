I wouldn\u2019t want to ruin what could be a beautiful experience for you.<\/p>\n<p>This is not so much as a review, as 21 reasons why Jessica Hepburn should step onto the stage and take a bow.<!--more--><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 1: Skilful narration<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>21 Miles is about Jessica\u2019s endeavour to swim the Channel after 11 unsuccessful rounds of IVF, which she has written about in her previous book, The Pursuit of Motherhood. She gets a skilful narration point for telling the IVF backstory in a way that makes sense to those who don&#8217;t already know it but which isn\u2019t repetitive to those who do.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 2:<\/strong> <strong>Swimming<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s an awesome thing that\u2019s hard to describe. Jessica captures it both physically and metaphorically. \u201cI can feel tears in my goggles but here in the pool, no one knows, not even the water, because water only knows tears as itself.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 3:<\/strong> <strong>Nature<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not just any old swimming but open water swimming that Jessica\u2019s doing here. So the book is also about our relationship with nature. \u201cEven though I feel small and vulnerable, as I start to swim I also feel something else. The words of a poem my dad used to recite to me when I was a child come unbidden into my mind: \u2018And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid, But even so, honoured still more\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 4:<\/strong> <strong>Humour<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>What can I say? This girl\u2019s hilarious.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 5<\/strong>: <strong>Food<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As if it wasn\u2019t enough to connect motherhood and swimming, Jessica makes this into a food story too. In so doing she integrates another of those themes that\u2019s BIG for most women. Big love to Jessica for her fully-fledged fest of all things edible.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 6<\/strong>: <strong>Skilful narration<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>She gets another skilful narration point for integrating such diverse themes into a coherent story.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 7:<\/strong> <strong>Other women<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Jessica invites women, ranging from scientist Baroness Greenfield (childless) to businesswoman Nicola Horlick (mother of six), to have lunch with her and answer the question of whether motherhood makes you happy. This is interesting, as it\u2019s a question we don\u2019t tend to ask. It\u2019s also beautifully expansive as she finds a point of connection in each of the women\u2019s baby stories and thereby binds them (us) together.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 8:<\/strong> <strong>Reflections on motherhood<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>She might have missed the experience of motherhood but she had the meaning (to paraphrase TS Eliot). Through her quest she unveils insights that are fuller and deeper than those of many a literal mother.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 9:<\/strong> <strong>Skilful narration<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Jessica asks each of the women to give her one word to take with her on her swim and in so doing creates a poem. She deserves a skilful narration point for the very idea. When she has to dig deep in her swim, she recalls those words with each stroke. In so doing takes all the women she has interviewed with her and, by extension, all of womankind too. God bless you, Jessica.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 10:<\/strong> <strong>Vulnerability<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This vulnerability is all the more powerful because it\u2019s shared before the wound has healed. \u201cSometimes I think the hardest thing about what I\u2019ve been through \u2013 what we\u2019ve been through \u2013 is that it makes it difficult to love because you\u2019re so frightened of happiness being taken away.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 11:<\/strong> <strong>Living for the<\/strong> <strong>unborn children<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A fellow swimmer, Nick, says swimming the Channel is all about the strength of the things deep inside you that are driving you forward. Jessica discovers her motivation. \u201cMille Gade swam the Channel for her children. I\u2019m swimming it for me and Gertrude Ederle and the children we never had.\u201d I find this both poignant and deeply inspiring.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 12: Uterus-power<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Jessica has her doubters, the greatest of which is Chris, who doesn&#8217;t think she stands a hope in Hell\u2019s chance because she\u2019s always complaining about the cold. But Jessica unveiled what the competitive sportsman couldn\u2019t see \u2013 the gravitational pull of the womb.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 13:<\/strong> <strong>Healing of family<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not part of the core narrative, but along the way Jessica grows in appreciation for her mum and dad and their own journeys into parenthood. It\u2019s a beautiful reaching back as the stretches forward. After her swim, she goes for a picnic with her mum. \u201cBecause although neither of us quite had the family of our dreams, we do have the family of our reality and that will always be something to treasure.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 14:<\/strong> <strong>Control<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are plenty in our culture who make out we can control our destiny through a mix of positive thinking and grim determination. Swimming the Channel and making a baby give the lie to that. This book tells a more truthful story \u2013 about the dance between what we can control and what we can\u2019t and is all the more inspiring for it.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 15: Conclusion 1 &#8211; sadness<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>And so Jessica starts to reach her conclusions on her search for the meaning of motherhood. \u201cEvery single person in the world seems to have something that makes them terribly sad. And life is about making the best of your sad thing.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 16: Conclusion 2 &#8211; connection<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\u201cConnection is vital to human happiness and if you can\u2019t get it ready-made by having your own children you need to create it in different ways.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 17: Conclusion 3 &#8211; something else<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Jessica recognises that however much women want to have children, they need to have something else as well. I am sure this is true. There is, at the heart of motherhood, and ambivalence. We want our children, but we also want to get back to our \u201csomething else\u201d \u2013 our work, our silence, our creativity, whatever it is. If we don\u2019t have a something else, it will be very difficult to let our children go as they grow up. So the something else is at the heart of motherhood as well as the heart of life.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 18: Skilful narration<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Jessica manages to keep the story twisting to the end. In almost the last chapter, she reveals she had asked each woman what they would eat for their last supper. When she has finished her swim, she eats that food as a celebration. It\u2019s a surprising detail, all the better for being held back and which celebrates the symbolic power of food as well as nicely concluding the theme.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 19: Climax 3 &#8211;<\/strong> <strong>relationship<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are three endings to this story, each of which had me in tears. The final (surprising) climax is the last word \u2013 love \u2013 which Jessica\u2019s partner, Peter, giver her retrospectively as her Channel word. This is a story about what 11 failed attempts at IVF can do to a relationship. (It\u2019s also NOT a story about what 11 failed attempts at IVF can do to a relationship and Jessica gets a bonus skilful narration point for the way she manages to tell the story while empathically not telling that story in deference to Peter\u2019s desire for privacy.)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 20: Climax 2 &#8211; She did it!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>She bloody well did it! Listen to that sound. It\u2019s the sound of all my eggs rushing down my fallopian tubes to stand on the edge of my uterus cheering. Well done Jessica! Bloody, menstrual bloody, well done!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bow 21: Climax 3 \u2013 mother<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>For me, the most profound part of the book was when Jessica\u2019s mother gave her childless daughter the word \u201cmother\u201d to swim the Channel with. I could have cried her a Channel. I almost did.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you\u2019ve not got backache from all the bowing, Jessica. But you\u2019ve swum the Channel, so you should be OK. What more can I say? Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Warning: Don\u2019t read this post if you\u2019re interested in fertility and haven\u2019t yet read 21 Miles, Swimming in Search of the Meaning of Motherhood by Jessica Hepburn.
