										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There I was making all the preparations for Arch&#8217;s fifth birthday &#8211; cake (tick), presents (tick), balloons (tick), card (tick).</p>
<p>&#8220;Now darling,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;There&#8217;s something you need to learn and it&#8217;s very important.<span id="more-739"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;When somebody gives you a present, you must say: &#8216;Thank you very much&#8217; whatever you think of it.  Even if you don&#8217;t like it, even if you&#8217;ve already got it, remember the people who gave it to you have been thoughtful and kind &#8211; so thank them.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Learning to say thank you</h3>
<p>I had no faith in Arch&#8217;s ability to learn this lesson so, at his party, I was in full control-mode whisking presents out of his hand to avert social calamities. &#8220;We&#8217;re having far too much fun to open them now, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>The crunch came a few days later when friends dropped by with a late present for Arch and we had no reason (pretend or otherwise) not to open it there and then in front of them.</p>
<p>Arch eagerly tore at the wrappings. It was Mr Men pants. I curled my toes &#8211; too young for him, not his thing, nothing he could play with&#8230;. What was Arch going to say?</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; he said,  confidently looking my friends in the eye.</p>
<p>Afterwards I sat Arch on my knee and told him how proud I was of what he had done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought I was going to like the present &#8211; but I didn&#8217;t. It was boring.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Learning to put on a mask</h3>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; I said, &#8220;but you learnt something very important about not hurting people&#8217;s feelings.  I&#8217;m really proud of you darling. Well done.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as I said the words, I felt my heart contract.</p>
<p>If what Arch has learnt was so good and useful &#8211; why had it made me sad?</p>
