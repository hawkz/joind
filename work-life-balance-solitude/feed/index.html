					<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t playing online a form of day-dreaming and re-creation?  If you get reading and clicking with no fixed agenda other than to explore and cross-pollenate, can you not be &quot;wasting&quot; time in a prayerful and creative way?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I prefer the terms day-dreaming and re-creation, the latter particularly as it describes what&#039;s really going on...just wish I could spend, sorry, invest, more time doing it as I tend to be drawn by my interests online/Facebook (does that make IT the current opium of the masses?! ;) )...it&#039;s part of the problem of being a reader/cross pollenator..internet butterfly, moi?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Wasting&quot; time is a hugely under-rated activity. I&#039;ve spent far too many a day beating myself up for wasting time after a hard week at work. In fact it&#039;s an essential part of the process of moving from one mode into another. Here&#039;s to more time-wasting.  It would be good to see you at Greenbelt. I&#039;m on Monday at 1pm Literature Marquee.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi I really liked this. Will look out for your talk at GB10. &#039;wasting&#039; Saturday mornings at my kitchen table drinking tea randomly scanning twitter generally stopping and not moving are an essential part of my recovery from and reflection on my week. Sundays are another alarm click day due to church and choir commitments so Saturday am is my time. I need it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more. Although I can&#039;t comment on looking after a family I do know how you feel about making the most of that little bit of solitude. Whether it&#039;s just to sit quietly for an hour to gather your thoughts, go for a walk or even go swimming (something I find really helps let me gather my thoughts), it&#039;s vital to have that bit of alone time or you&#039;ll just end up going mad.]]></description>
