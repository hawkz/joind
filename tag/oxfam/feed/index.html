										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have had the great pleasure of being let loose in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oxfamkingsheath?fref=ts" target="_blank">Oxfam Bookshop in Kings  Heath</a>, Birmingham. The store came up with a great idea &#8211; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/524028804420470/" target="_blank">The Curated Shelf</a> &#8211; to bring  writers and readers closer together.  During September, it invited five local authors and members of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/oxfamreads" target="_blank">OxfamReads!</a> series to curate shelves from the  donated offerings.<span id="more-1931"></span></p>
<p>The writers were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="fsl"><a href="http://davidhartbirminghampoet.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">David Hart</a>, 1997/8 Birmingham Poet Laureate</span></li>
<li><span class="fsl"> <a href="http://www.catherineoflynn.com/" target="_blank">Catherine O’Flynn</a>, winner 2008 First Novel Award at the Costa Book Awards</span></li>
<li><span class="fsl"> <a href="http://www.katharinedsouza.co.uk/" target="_blank">Katherine D’Souza</a>, author of the Birmingham-set novels “Deeds Not Words” and “Park Life”</span></li>
<li><span class="fsl">Gaynor Arnold, whose work “Girl in a Blue Dress” was long-listed for the 2008 Man Booker Prize</span></li>
<li><span class="fsl"><a href="https://joind.co.uk" target="_blank">Jo Ind</a> &#8211; yes, that&#8217;s me &#8211; author or Memories of Bliss, former Birmingham Post journalist.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I greatly enjoyed being able to choose any book I wanted from the store to sit on my shelf.  It was better than being a child let loose in a sweet shop.</p>
<p>Rarely, do I allow myself just to pick what I want.  Normally my book selections are constrained by concerns about money and whether I will have time to actually read whatever title I’m considering.  For The Curated Shelf, I could just pick what I fancied and there was a luxurious freedom in that.</p>
<p>My shelf turned out to be biographical.  I chose books I had enjoyed as child and enjoy reading with my own little boy (Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle), novels where I had interviewed the author through my work as a journalist, sheet music because I love singing and playing the piano, a book on language to reflect my enduring interest as a philosopher and writer.  In picking whatever I wanted, I found a story of my life displayed through the spines on books. That felt pleasurable and somehow important to me.</p>
<p>I hope people enjoyed looking at the curations as much as I enjoyed selecting the items &#8211; but I doubt that they could have done simply because I enjoyed it so very much.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three of my favourite things will be coming together on Wednesday, 25 February 2015.</p>
<p>First of all the treasure trove which is the <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/" target="_blank">Oxfam</a> Bookshop on Kings Heath High Street, Birmingham will be celebrating its refurbishment.  Still cosy, still welcoming, it will be enjoying a brand new look.<span id="more-1760"></span></p>
<p>Secondly, that treasure trove which is Katrice Horsley will be there telling tales in a way that only a national storytelling laureate can.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the theme of the morning will be <a title="How has being a mother affected my creativity?" href="https://joind.co.uk/mother-creativity/" target="_blank">motherhood and creativity</a> (one of my top topics) &#8211; and I shall be there discussing it with Katrice and you too, if you would care to come along.</p>
<p>Do you see motherhood as the ultimate creative act &#8211; or something that makes it impossible to get on with your own creative work? What&#8217;s the difference between raising a child and making art?</p>
<p>We will be telling stories, reading texts and sharing anecdotes on the theme of motherhood and creation at 11am to mark the re-opening of the Oxfam store.</p>
<p>Anyone is welcome but please note the event is for adults rather than children.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motherhood and Creativity with Jo Ind and Katrice Horsley is on Wednesday 25 February 2015 at 11am at the Oxfam Bookshop, 110A Kings Heath High Street B14 7LG.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
