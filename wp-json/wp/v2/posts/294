My little boy, Arch, is now three-and-a-half and stays all day at nursery but for the first two years of his life, we had no childcare at all. My husband and I would swap work for the baby, literally picking one up and putting the other down.\u00a0 I didn&#8217;t have time to turn a computer on, never mind do anything creative once I had.<\/p>\n<p>I have been through an experience that has rocked and shocked me &#8211; giving birth. I have been blissed-out beyond my imagining &#8211; lying with a sleeping new born on my chest.\u00a0 I have wanted to grab these experiences with both hands and squeeze every last drop I can from them. For me, that means writing about them. But I simply haven&#8217;t had the space or time.<\/p>\n<h3>A room of my own at last<\/h3>\n<p>Today all that has changed. With the help of my friends Chris Duggan and Emma Jones, I have created a website.\u00a0 The name has been chosen, the pages furnished, the images polished, the typos swept.\u00a0 My blog is a playroom, a study, a chapel, and a dance floor all at the same time.
