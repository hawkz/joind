Anastasia is looking for romance. Christian can\u2018t get turned on when sex is vanilla.\u00a0 Can they find a way of getting it together despite their seemingly incompatible sexualities?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an interesting question and one that raises questions for us all about compromise within sex, going outside our comfort zones, working out what we really don\u2019t like and what we could develop a taste for.<\/p>\n<h3>Confusing sadomasochism with domestic violence<\/h3>\n<p>Last month the discussion took a darker turn. \u00a0Clare Phillipson, director of Wearside Women in Need, a charity for victims of domestic violence, called for women to burn their copies on 5 November along with an effigy of Christian Grey, on the grounds that it is \u201can instruction manual for an abusive individual to sexually torture a vulnerable young woman.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Phillipson claims the story is about a domestic violence perpetrator who takes someone who is less experienced and powerful, spins her a yarn, starts doing horrific sexual things to her and makes it seem normal. \u00a0She worries that teenagers will be picking the book up and thinking: \u201cThis is alright.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>The church needs a foothold in Fifty Shades debates<\/h3>\n<p>I think it\u2019s important for the church to get a foothold in the discussion at this point, but it\u2019s difficult for it to do so because historically its understanding of sexual ethics has been focussed on procreative acts &#8211; heterosexual vaginal intercourse in the context of marriage and so on. This way of thinking has nothing to offer when exploring Fifty Shades of Grey-type dilemmas.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing that I would say to Phillipson is that I can understand why women who have been beaten by their partners are highly-sensitised to beatings in erotic fantasies. I have sympathy with those who are reminded, through reading Fifty Shades of Grey,\u00a0of being stalked and abused and traumatised.<\/p>\n<p>But I would also say that it is very important to draw a distinction between a scenario in which a woman consents to being spanked because it turns her on and in which there is an agreed safe word for her say when she wants it to stop, and one in which a chap simply beats the Hell out of her.<\/p>\n<h3>Christian Grey is a role-model<\/h3>\n<p>I think Christian Grey goes far further than your average bloke in ensuring that Anastasia really is consenting to what they do in sex. On that count, he is a role-model.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that,\u00a0I agree that \u201cconsent\u201d is slippery. There is an argument that women have been socialised to be submissive to men and that the submissive\/dominant dynamic has been eroticised. A woman\u2019s desire to be submissive could be seen as evidence of her oppression rather than her liberation, even if she does consent to it.<\/p>\n<p>I agree with that. Besides, we all know we can \u201cconsent\u201d to things because we\u2019re vulnerable, because our options are limited, because we think everybody else is doing it, because we feel we want something but when we actually do it we realise that we don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h3>Consent is tricksy<\/h3>\n<p>Consent is dynamic, it\u2019s tricksy and it can take considerable skill and experience to discern when it is deep and authentic and when it is half-baked and mistaken.<\/p>\n<p>This is where the church has a great deal to offer. It has a very handy tool up its sleeve for assessing the quality of consent &#8211; the teachings of Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuit Order.<\/p>\n<h3>Ignatius&#8217; discernment can be used in sex<\/h3>\n<p>Ignatius taught about consolation and desolation. When we are consoled, he said, new energy is released and we feel closer to others. When we are desolate, we turn in on ourselves and feel drained. With practice we can evaluate our experiences according to how desolate or consoled they made us and we can choose to live more in consolation.<\/p>\n<p>I think this practice is invaluable in discerning whether our sexual experiences are truly what we want or whether we are being manipulated and compromising where we shouldn\u2019t be. If Anastasia came to me for help in her dilemma with Christian,\u00a0I would offer her St Ignatius. \u00a0\u201cWhen you are playing with Christian,\u00a0listen very carefully to your feelings, both as it\u2019s happening and afterwards. \u00a0How is it making you feel? \u00a0Is it making you feel peaceful and fully alive? Is it making you withdraw and contract inside?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In all my readings of sex manuals and feminist literature, I have found nothing as useful as this tool for improving sex.\u00a0 The church has so much to offer in making better lovers of us all. Come on.
