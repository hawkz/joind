					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right Katy! It IS terrible to put speech marks around &quot;poetry&quot;!  It&#039;s wonderful that you felt the desire to write, found the time, and actually did it.  Well done you.  Please greet your poems with the same joy and respect you would great poems that HAD been written by your five-year-old.  It&#039;s great that you wrote them. Congratulations.  (And of course now I want to read them!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not a writer, although I have had one blog published and paid for in my lifetime for which I shall be eternally proud!! Writing for me is also very hard, but the main difference is that I&#039;m also not really any good at it!!! The &quot;poetry&quot; I wrote this summer has had to have speech marks around it - a terrible thing to do I know - but it wasn&#039;t good enough to just write the word poetry, on it&#039;s own - intact if anyone read them they&#039;d be likely to guess my 5 year old was the author!!]]></description>
