I can buy myself the time to learn.<\/p>\n<p>My plan is to spend the first few months of next year getting to know how websites are made. I want to learn HTML code. I want to understand FTP, SEO and WBMP format. I want to get canny with the back end of the internet so I can be more effective in the way I use it up front.<\/p>\n<h3>I love digital<\/h3>\n<p>I love the internet for its scope, its flexibility, its speed, its diversity and its potential to create community. I&#8217;m excited by the way, in theory at least, it makes it possible for anyone to tell his or her story. I came into journalism because I believe in story-telling. The world wide web has made this possible in ways that were unimaginable just 20 years ago. This is a good thing.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, it is also bringing about the crisis in the media industries which I and my colleagues are finding so painful at the moment. I have no idea what form the media of the future will take. I don&#8217;t know if Murdoch will prove that readers are happy to pay for newspapers online and thereby rescue not only the Times but the whole newspaper industry.<\/p>\n<h3>I\u00a0want to combine story-telling and digital skills<\/h3>\n<p>I can&#8217;t tell if the Guardian&#8217;s response of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandrepublic.com\/News\/928710\/Guardian-moves-ahead-plans-readers-club\/\">inviting readers to subscribe to a newspaper-based club<\/a> will turn out to be the business model that rescues all print from terminal decline. I have a sneaky feeling that Clay Shirky might be right when he says saving newspapers is not the answer and the whole edifice needs to come tumbling down before the new journalism &#8211; whatever it is &#8211; can emerge.<\/p>\n<p>But I have a hunch that whatever form the media of the future is going to take, whether it will be niche and hyperlocal or multi-tasking in multi-media conglomerates, the people who are going to be really useful are those who combine traditional story-telling skills with both a social and technical understanding of the web.<\/p>\n<p>I want to be one of those people. I&#8217;m fortunate in having the opportunity to become one. With moist eyes and tender feelings for the team to which I have belonged for almost all my adult life, I have handed in my form&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>*<\/strong><em>I wrote this post originally for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.birminghampost.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Birmingham Post<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have just volunteered to leave a newspaper I love and a job about which I am passionate.
