					<description><![CDATA[Jo, thanks for the excellent workshop earlier this month. I came away buzzing with ideas and have now set up my own Blog! I am still getting to grips with the &#039;technical&#039; side of things but I am already addicted to my blog - and can&#039;t wait for the first &#039;comment&#039;! I absolutely agree with you that it&#039;s like putting a photo album together. I love finding nice piccies to liven up the pages!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad you enjoyed the workshop, Rickie. 

For me, the archive element is part of the pleasure.  That&#039;s one of the ways in which it&#039;s like a photo album - something to scroll through and use as a way to remember. Thanks for the comment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[love and miss your writting jo.
Also thought of other reasons to blog. to be free, to be active and alive, to jump into new experiences, to rediscover myself and others, to see myself differently. To love to see beauty to be creative, to help the sun to shine brighter, and many many more.
