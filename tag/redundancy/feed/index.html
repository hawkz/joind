										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">I get heartily sick of the challenge of raising a family being characterised in terms of work-life balance.</p>
<p>Who thought of that phrase?<span id="more-534"></span></p>
<p>It makes it sound as though the only things we need are to earn a living and spend time with our families.  The implication is that so long as we&#8217;ve risen to the  challenge of getting work and childcare covered, we&#8217;re sorted.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ve got news &#8211; we&#8217;re not.</p>
<h3>I need solitude</h3>
<p>I have another need and that need is for <a href="https://joind.co.uk/no-solitude-like-home/" target="_blank">solitude</a>.  I&#8217;ll say it again, but louder: &#8220;SOLITUDE.&#8221;</p>
<p>I need time to be alone/pray/write. (I use forward slashes rather than commas because I&#8217;m not sure if they are different things.)</p>
<p>It is that need for solitude that too often goes unrecognised and therefore gets squeezed and therefore needs naming in capital letters.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I agreed to give a talk on revelation, identity and social media at the <a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/" target="_blank">Greenbelt Festival</a>. I rashly took this on in January when I had just taken redundancy and therefore anticipated I might be twiddling my thumbs around the August Bank Holiday (ho, ho).</p>
<h3>What  difference three days makes</h3>
<p>As a result I have  had to clear the time (three whole days so far) to be by myself and do a bit of reading and thinking and praying and writing &#8211; whatever name you give to what I do in my study.</p>
<p>Do you know? It has made me feel so good&#8230;. I was able to pay attention to random thoughts that had surfaced and been left hanging around like odd socks for far too many years.  I felt peaceful, deeper, &#8216;gathered-in.&#8217;</p>
<p>I must do this more often. I WILL do it more often. Prayer/writing/solitude might not get named in &#8220;having it all&#8221; features in glossy magazines but I&#8217;m naming it and I&#8217;m doing it now.</p>

<p>I have just volunteered to leave a newspaper I love and a job about which I am passionate.</p>
<p>Last week Trinity Mirror, the company that owns the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/">Birmingham Post</a>, announced 41 journalists in the Midlands are to lose their jobs by the end of the year. I am offering to leave as part of the cull.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
</div>
<p><span id="more-251"></span></p>
<div id="more">
<h3>I want to learn digital media</h3>
<p>I want to leave so I can become a writer who is as competent in the digital arena as I currently am in print.</p>
<p>I am in a more fortunate position than many of my colleagues in that I have worked for BPM Media, as it is now known, for 21 years and so my pay-off is relatively comfortable. I can buy myself the time to learn.</p>
<p>My plan is to spend the first few months of next year getting to know how websites are made. I want to learn HTML code. I want to understand FTP, SEO and WBMP format. I want to get canny with the back end of the internet so I can be more effective in the way I use it up front.</p>
<h3>I love digital</h3>
<p>I love the internet for its scope, its flexibility, its speed, its diversity and its potential to create community. I&#8217;m excited by the way, in theory at least, it makes it possible for anyone to tell his or her story. I came into journalism because I believe in story-telling. The world wide web has made this possible in ways that were unimaginable just 20 years ago. This is a good thing.</p>
<p>Sadly, it is also bringing about the crisis in the media industries which I and my colleagues are finding so painful at the moment. I have no idea what form the media of the future will take. I don&#8217;t know if Murdoch will prove that readers are happy to pay for newspapers online and thereby rescue not only the Times but the whole newspaper industry.</p>
<h3>I want to combine story-telling and digital skills</h3>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell if the Guardian&#8217;s response of <a href="http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/928710/Guardian-moves-ahead-plans-readers-club/">inviting readers to subscribe to a newspaper-based club</a> will turn out to be the business model that rescues all print from terminal decline. I have a sneaky feeling that Clay Shirky might be right when he says saving newspapers is not the answer and the whole edifice needs to come tumbling down before the new journalism &#8211; whatever it is &#8211; can emerge.</p>
<p>But I have a hunch that whatever form the media of the future is going to take, whether it will be niche and hyperlocal or multi-tasking in multi-media conglomerates, the people who are going to be really useful are those who combine traditional story-telling skills with both a social and technical understanding of the web.</p>
<p>I want to be one of those people. I&#8217;m fortunate in having the opportunity to become one. With moist eyes and tender feelings for the team to which I have belonged for almost all my adult life, I have handed in my form&#8230;.</p>
