					<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh.  What a lot of people I haven&#039;t replied to. I am SO sorry. I must have been too spiritual to respond, eh @Nancy ;).

@Michael - writing is never effortless for me, whether I&#039;m passionate about the subject or not.

@Ally - an interesting question.  But I was amazed to discover I only had to right click on my friend&#039;s blog and it was magically translated from Arabic into English. Perhaps this will become less of an issue as technology develops.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi all,
It&#039;s true, writing is fun, but I think it&#039;s much easier for people who know English very well (bigger audience)
It&#039;s nice to check your stats &#038; see you had some visitors (readers)
I speak Danish ; this means only 5 million potential readers - frustrating 
Should I write in English ?]]></description>

I totally agree. You will always have a hard time writing about a subject that you are not passionate about. However when you are passionate about it you will find the words as effortlessly as breathing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You need to have spirituality when you write in order to connect with your audience/readers. I find this to be so true that at times I am held back from writing a post or commenting on a blog. Guess that&#039;s what you&#039;re referring to here.

My 2 cents,

Nancy]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is true that Spirituality is when the inside of things is bigger than the outside. It just really shows that spirituality really matters especially to a blogger..

It makes for a blogger hard to write if he/she doesn&#039;t have spirituality inside him/her.]]></description>
