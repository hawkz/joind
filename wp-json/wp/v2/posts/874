This has worked to some extent but not completely.<\/p>\n<p>So now I&#8217;m trying a different tack. \u00a0I&#8217;m doing exercises to help my heel every day and trying to ease\u00a0myself back into running kilometre by gentle kilometre.<\/p>\n<p>And doesn&#8217;t it feel good? Doesn&#8217;t it feel great to be out in my running shoes again? To be getting fitter rather than slobbier? To be toning-up rather than filling-out?\u00a0To be moving in the direction of a solid, firm torso rather than a wobbly blob blancmanged at the end of the sofa?<\/p>\n<h3>Getting fit is easy &#8211; it&#8217;s resting that&#8217;s hard<\/h3>\n<p>And that is my point: \u00a0getting fit is the easy bit. All it requires is a bit of will-power. If we decide that is what we want to do, most of us can do it.<\/p>\n<p>But my aspirations are deeper. I want to learn to be as happy when I am recovering from a running injury as I am when I am getting fitter.<\/p>\n<p>I want to embrace the whole of life and life involves being tired, being ill, being old and being injured.<\/p>\n<h3>How to be happy when you are becoming a wobbly blob<\/h3>\n<p>Even if I were to run a marathon, what would I do when I had done it? \u00a0No one can&#8217;t get fitter indefinitely. The time has to come when I am becoming\u00a0less strong and becoming what I (in my fear) perceive as a wobbly blob.<\/p>\n<p>My challenge is this &#8211; to be happy when I&#8217;m moving in that direction too.\u00a0Unless I can crack that, \u00a0I&#8217;m only living half a life &#8211; and the easy half at that.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am still recovering from plantar fasciitis, a strain on my right heel brought about because my determination to run has been greater than my willingness to listen to my body.
