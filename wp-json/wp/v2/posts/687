The service has made a film of two women, of similar height, both classed as overweight in BMI terms.\u00a0 The women were put through a body volume index (BVI) scanner that can distinguish between muscle and fat at Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham.\u00a0 Despite being a similar height and weight, the scanner found one woman was healthy and the other needed to lose some fat.<\/p>\n<p>At last, I can fully believe what my friends and Phil, my highly-toned and clincially obese (in BMI terms) personal trainer is telling me.\u00a0 &#8220;Muscle weighs more than fat.&#8221; It really does. Thank you, Dr Asad Rahim, from Heartlands Hospital.<\/p>\n<p>As for you, scales. &#8220;Bye bye.&#8221;\u00a0 I measure my waist and that&#8217;s all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have always said that the hallmark of a good writer is one who is changed through her words.
