I made a Fifty Shades of Gold website too.<\/p>\n<p>Now I have been invited to speak on Fifty Shades of Gold at two beautiful venues in Birmingham.

The talk will include time\u00a0for quiet and discussion. \u00a0You get to see the work in all its awesome glory and have the chance to ask questions. \u00a0It&#8217;s Fifty Shades of Gold in the flesh &#8211; well, in the paint and gold, in the case of the artwork.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Entrance fee:<\/strong> \u00a34<\/p>\n<p><strong>Booking:<\/strong>\u00a0recommended but not necessary &#8211; 0121 262 1840 or enquiries@birminghamcathedral.com<\/p>\n<p><strong>Google maps:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.co.uk\/maps\/place\/Birmingham,+West+Midlands+B3+2QB\/@52.4811087,-1.8989949,17z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4870bc8e9c7d5dc7:0xfd7cbd4b70069273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Birmingham Cathedral<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><b>Winterbourne House &amp; Garden, Tuesday 18 March:<\/b>\u00a0<strong>12.30-1.30pm<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I am delighted to be speaking at the gem that is\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.winterbourne.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Winterbourne House &amp; Garden<\/a> as part of Birmingham University&#8217;s Arts &amp; Science Festival, in partnership with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.writingwestmidlands.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Writing West Midlands<\/a>. \u00a0Jake&#8217;s work will be at the Cathedral so I will be showing it in a different way &#8211; using digital images showing detail that can sometimes be missed.
