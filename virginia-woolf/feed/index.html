					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Sonya, Martin, Linda, Andy and Clare for your kind, encouraging comments.  It&#039;s been a pleasure having you all in my room.  I&#039;m sorry it&#039;s taking me a while to respond.  This is the first time I&#039;ve had a blog of my own and I hadn&#039;t realised I had to approve of you before you could be published. But I do approve, I do.

PS - make sure you do it, Martin. I think it&#039;s essential.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jo; I&#039;m very impressed! I will need to start a blog site of my own for after I leave the Post four weeks tomorrow. It would be great to think I could get something up and running before then, but I don&#039;t see me having the time. I&#039;m taking small steps into being involved with this 
http://www.tamworthblog.co.uk/ but my own site where I could muse on music, football, travel, real ale, naturism, politics, sport and the world generally would be terrific. Here&#039;s hoping,

Regards,
Martin Warrillow]]></description>
