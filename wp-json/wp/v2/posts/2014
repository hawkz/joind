In some rural parishes, the average church-goer was older than 65 . This can be seen negatively &#8211; indeed it usually is \u2013 but it could also be an indication that the church is good at serving the needs of the elderly.<\/p>\n<p>Canon <a href=\"https:\/\/jameswoodward.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">James Woodward<\/a>, author of <a href=\"http:\/\/jameswoodward.sdnet.co.uk\/valuingage.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Valuing Age<\/a>, says: \u201cThe deepest roots of loneliness are spiritual. The distinctive gift of the church is that it helps us engage with the vulnerabilities we become so aware of in old age.\u201d<br \/>\nIt also provides an intergenerational community. \u201cWhen I worked with a care sheltered community at Temple Balsall, people would often say it was a very nice, but they didn\u2019t want to live only with other older people,\u201d says James. \u201cThe church creates community, across generations, between young and old, which many older people enjoy and need.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But Ruth Swift, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ageuk.org.uk\/oxfordshire\/\" target=\"_blank\">Age UK Oxfordshire<\/a>, cautions against complacency. \u201cChurches can inadvertently make older people feel invisible by not asking their ideas, by publishing youth events far and wide while assuming everyone knows about activities for older people, by providing information in a small font that older people can\u2019t read\u2026 All these things subliminally contribute to loneliness by communicating that older people aren\u2019t as valued. But churches do care and when they think about these things, they care fantastically well.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Fact file on loneliness and older people<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>As many as 13% of people aged 75 or over said they were always or often lonely.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>More than 40% of people aged 65 and over in the UK feel out of touch with the pace of modern life and 12% say they feel cut off from society.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Nearly half of older people say that television or pets are their main form of company.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Five per cent of people aged over 65 say they spent Christmas Day alone.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>More than 10% of over 65s said they never spent time with their family.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Only 35% of people aged over 65 spent time with friends most days or every day in the last two weeks, and 12% never did.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>A third of people aged 55 or over (33%) would like to live closer to family so that we could see them more often.<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]<\/a>Later Life in the United Kingdom: Age UK (2015)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\">[2]<\/a> As above<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\">[3]<\/a> As above<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\">[4]<\/a> As above<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref5\" name=\"_ftn5\">[5]<\/a> As above<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref6\" name=\"_ftn6\">[6]<\/a> As above<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref7\" name=\"_ftn7\">[7]<\/a> Griffin J, The Lonely Society?
