<p>Small businesses, start-ups and charities can book in for one-to-one mentoring sessions with Digital Garage technicians who will help improve their website, their social media presence, the way they use Adwords and much, much more.</p>
<p>The two training seminars are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tell your story online</strong> &#8211; creating a good website, making it mobile-friendly, using insights gained from data to improve your site and using social media to boost your digital presence</li>
<li><strong>Reach new customers online</strong> &#8211; understanding how search works, being more findable in both regular (organic) and paid search</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s all free, but it won&#8217;t be there for ever.   The Garage will pop up for a few months in the Library of Birmingham and then pop up in another city, so get your Google goodies while you can.</p>
<ul>
<li>Register for Free Training at the Birmingham Garage</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PLEASURE</strong>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it, I&#8217;ve said it.</p>
<p>I was leading a workshop for Birmingham Book Festival last weekend called Finding Your Blogging Voice. One of the first things we did was brainstorm our reasons for blogging. Between us we said:<span id="more-601"></span></p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
<li>to have a voice</li>
<li>to showcase work</li>
<li>to create an archive of material</li>
<li>to explain a business</li>
<li>to connect with people</li>
<li>to improve SEO.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was leading the workshop and so I forgot to say that, though I do indeed get all those benefits from blogging, my number one reason for going tap, tap, tap is because I enjoy it.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of different pleasures, of course.</p>
<h3>Blogging isn&#8217;t like sex</h3>
<p>The pleasure of blogging isn&#8217;t like that of sex or swimming or lying on the sofa with a glass of wine. It&#8217;s  more like the pleasure of making a photo album &#8211; but using word-pictures rather than images.</p>
<p>And, <a href="https://joind.co.uk/virginia-woolf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I said when I created this website,</a> it&#8217;s like the pleasure of having my own room and getting it just how I want &#8211; my own little bit of cyberpace where I can play and muse and hang out with my friends.</p>
<p>In her seminal post <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/06/13/megnut.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What We&#8217;re Doing When We Blog,</a> Meg Hourian talks about the anatomy of a post and the communication evolution etc.  It&#8217;s all good stuff.</p>
<p>But she doesn&#8217;t say: &#8220;Having fun.&#8221;  That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing when I blog and the day it stops being enjoyable, is the day I&#8217;ll stop blogging.</p>
