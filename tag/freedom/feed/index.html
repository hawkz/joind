										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Have you had a good summer?&#8221;  That&#8217;s something people tend to ask around this time of year and for the past 20 years I have scowled in response.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t ask &#8216;Have you had a good autumn?&#8217; Or &#8216;Have you had a good spring?'&#8221;  I would mutter as I sat at my desk working all through July and August.  &#8220;What is this &#8216;summer&#8217; thing?&#8221;<span id="more-948"></span></p>
<p>But that was before I had a little boy. That was before early September brought the ritual of  ironing name-tapes into sweat-shirts and getting feet measured for Jack Nano shoes.</p>
<p>This week, as I get the grey trousers down from the loft and hunt in the back of the cupboard for Tupperware,  I am amazed that despite working for four of the past six weeks, they have felt relaxed simply because days haven&#8217;t been truncated by 8.55am and 3.30pm deadlines.</p>
<h3>Oh the things we have done!</h3>
<p>Oh the things we have done! We&#8217;ve been to Barbados, been to cricket school, been to three festivals and to the Paralympic Games.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve made bread, made birds of paradise, made new friends and made-up songs,  stories and and jokes (don&#8217;t ask).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve paddled in pools, swam in a river and bobbed in the waves of the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve travelled by plane, by tube, by train, by bike, by taxi, by bus and by campervan singing along to Supertramp at the top of our voices.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve laughed, we&#8217;ve danced, we&#8217;ve sung, we&#8217;ve cheered, we&#8217;ve Mexican-waved &#8211; and we&#8217;ve got very, very muddy.</p>
<h3>Six glorious weeks</h3>
<p>They have been six glorious weeks in which we&#8217;ve stretched and flexed and doodled and meandered, got lost and re-united, discovered and re-discovered.</p>
<p>Arch and I have called it &#8220;adventuring&#8221;.  &#8220;Where shall we adventure to today?&#8221; we would say as we set off on another school-free day.</p>
<p>Another name for it is &#8220;summer.&#8221;  I get it now.</p>
<p>And there was me thinking I was giving it to Arch. In fact he was giving it to me.</p>
