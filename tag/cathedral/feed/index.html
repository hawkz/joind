										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend &#8211; Sunday, 9 June 2013 &#8211; I will be talking about sexuality at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/holygroundexeter/posts/469545393130447" target="_blank">Holy Ground</a> at Exeter Cathedral.</p>
<p>In preparing my talk, I&#8217;ve noticed that I have felt in a very quiet place around sexuality issues in recent years and found it almost unbearable listening to debates about the <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/marriagesamesexcouplesbill.html" target="_blank">Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill</a> currently going through Parliament.<span id="more-1039"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m not political.  Sexuality is a very political issue affected by the laws of the land that need changing, so some people have got to argue about it. There was a time when I would have been quite happy to be one of those people. Indeed I would have wanted it.</p>
<p>But now when those same arguments are being rehearsed over and over again in the The Mail,  The Sun, on Newsnight, on the Today programme, I find myself wincing and covering my ears (or eyes, depending&#8230;)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to shout about it.  I don&#8217;t want to argue about it &#8211; though I CAN. I just want to metaphorically take off my shoes and recognise that when we are talking about sexuality, we are indeed on holy ground.</p>
