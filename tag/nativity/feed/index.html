										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last time I blogged, I was <a title="https://joind.co.uk/2010/family/help-parents-help-my-pride-is-obscene" href="http://">asking for help</a>.</p>
<p>My pride at my four-year-old son, Arch, felt so overwhelming I felt it should not be seen in public. I wondered how other parents handled (or concealed) this obscenely primitive emotion.<span id="more-658"></span></p>
<p>As a result I have had three very helpful conversations, two on Facebook and one in the flesh, about the dilemma. (Is it a coincidence that the three people who helped me did not have children themselves?)</p>
<h3>Our collective ambivalence about pride</h3>
<p>One discussion was about our ambivalence about pride of any kind. Is it good or is it bad?</p>
<p>We expect people to take a pride in their work, for example, but if they are too proud we wag our fingers at them: &#8220;Pride comes before a fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>I look in the dictionary and see it means both &#8220;excessive self-esteem&#8221; and &#8220;self-respect, personal dignity.&#8221;Â  Those are two very different things &#8211; opposites even &#8211; and yet the same word covers both. No wonder it&#8217;s confusing.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s that interesting point about whether we can be proud of something that has got nothing to do with us. I would not think so &#8211; and yet I am.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m proud to be a citizen of a country with a national health service. Did I have anything to do with the creation of the NHS? No, but I&#8217;m proud of it nonetheless.</p>
<p>My pride in Arch feels like that kind of thing.</p>
<h3>Is gratitude a better word than pride?</h3>
<p>One Facebook friend suggested gratitude might be a better word for the kind of emotion I was describing than pride.</p>
<p>I like that idea. It certainly neatly evades all the ambiguities about &#8220;pride&#8221; and therefore makes the experience of the feeling easier.</p>
<p>Was I proud to see Arch playing the part of a star in his first nativity play earlier this week?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s put it like this. The day he was born I dropped to my knees and said: &#8220;No matter how long I live, I will never be able to express the depth of my gratitude that this archangel has come to make his home with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t stood up since.</p>
