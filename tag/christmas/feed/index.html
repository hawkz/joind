										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The problem with Christmas is that it&#8217;s based on the notion that having dinner with our extended families is a jolly good thing.</p>
<p>I wonder where that idea came from.<span id="more-676"></span></p>
<p>In general, the families that we have come from do not give us all that we need &#8211; and that is healthy. It is what gives us the momentum to leave home and find happiness and fulfilment in other ways.</p>
<p>If the family from which we have come has done well-enough, it will have enabled us to become resourceful adults who can form friendships, become part of communities, engage in meaningful work and&#8230;er&#8230;create families of our own.</p>
<p>But at Christmas we do a very strange thing. We put aside the things that really do nourish us and go back to the people and the environments from which we needed to move on.</p>
<p>(&#8216;Move on&#8217; is the right expression for those from happier families.Â  &#8216;Escape&#8217; is more apt for the rest of us.)</p>
<p>The strangest thing about this &#8211; the brandy butter on the Christmas pudding of this seasonal phenomenon &#8211; is that we make out this is special and wonderful and we&#8217;re all having a lovely time.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas everyone.</p>
