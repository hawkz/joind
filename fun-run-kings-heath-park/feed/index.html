					<description><![CDATA[This is really inspiring. I am moved by your story, Kings heath park is our nearest by far and is a great space for scooters, bike riding and ball games and most specially to just run. I find the place serene and I would have loved to join you on your 5km run. I run alone most of the time just me and my ipod.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry to hear that. There was a time when my health was such that I could barely walk, never mind run.  I am always remember that with gratitude when the alarm goes at 6am and I set off for my 8k run.  (I try to do 8k these days)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the lovely comment, Alia.  I went to the gym to do my weights today and I had no desire at all to get on the treadmill.  I went to the park instead. It&#039;s so nice to keep up with you through the blog. x]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[amazing piece Jo, so poetic, and artistic, I could see what you are describing. So true dear friend that it feels lonely and closed in the gym, and very open=spirited and active outdoor.Connecting with nature too as you described. Suddenly, you see solutions to unsolved old problems, remember forgotten friends. I love it.]]></description>
