										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="font_8"><span class="color_2">A very good question is going to be asked in Birmingham on Saturday, 28 May 2016. If one in six couples experience some form of infertility, why do they feel so alone?</span><span id="more-2104"></span></p>
<p class="font_8"><span class="color_2"><a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/" target="_blank">Birmingham Rep</a> will be the venue for <a href="http://www.fertilityfest.com/" target="_blank">Fertility Fest</a> &#8211; the first event of its kind in the UK.  Produced by <a href="https://thepursuitofmotherhood.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Jessica Hepburn</a> and Gabby Vautier, it will bring together 20 writers, visual artists, theatre-makers, film-directors and composers alongside some of the country&#8217;s foremost fertility experts.</span></p>
<p class="font_8"><span class="color_2">We will be talking about, and sharing art around, the diagnosis of infertility, IVF, donation,<span class="color_2"> surrogacy, the male experience, egg freezing, involuntary childlessness and alternative routes to parenthood.</span></span></p>
<h3 class="font_8">I will be crying</h3>
<p class="font_8">I will be there (speaking at 11.30am).  I think it&#8217;s highly unlikely I will manage to be there without crying. (I say that to prepare myself as much as anybody else.)</p>
<p class="font_8">Other people might want to talk about <span class="color_2">the effects of fertility science on future generations </span><span class="color_2">and how far as a society are we prepared to go in our pursuit of parenthood. </span>I want to be there because I want to stand in the same space as people whose deep longing to have children remains unfulfilled.   Grieving is inevitable.  There is no escaping that. But whatever else we feel, we do not need to feel alone.</p>

<h3>Day 26</h3>
<p>One day I shall look back at this time</p>
<p>At the waiting</p>
<p>And the counting</p>
<p>And the bleeding</p>
<p>And the longing</p>
<p>The trying</p>
<p>And the not-trying</p>
<p>The loving</p>
<p>And forgiving</p>
<p>And I will say that it made sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the time will come again</p>
<p>When my womb will be holding</p>
<p>The secret hope,</p>
<p>The possibility of miracle;</p>
<p>Origins so awesome</p>
<p>That only God can know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But today my vulva</p>
<p>Is tender-lipped</p>
<p>Heralding blood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And today is the day</p>
<p>I have to live</p>
<p>Right now</p>
<p>Learning to embrace</p>
<p>My own body and grieving dreams</p>
<p>With the fierce</p>
<p>Unconditional</p>
<p>Over-whelming</p>
<p>Mother’s love</p>
<p>That is present</p>
<p>That is ready</p>
<p>That is now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was preparing for my wedding, someone (I can&#8217;t remember who) said: &#8220;The most important part of a wedding is the photographs.&#8221;  She was a little shocked when I said we weren&#8217;t going to have a photographer as such &#8211;  just three friends taking candid shots and giving me their films the following week.<span id="more-2089"></span></p>
<p>If you are a photographer, I have no doubt photographs are indeed the most important part.  I imagine chefs feel the wedding breakfast is the bit that matters most.  But I am a writer.  And so for me it was the words over which I agonised as I wrote the service, for the most part, myself.</p>

<p>That was fifteen years ago today. The calligrapher <a href="http://www.ewanclayton.co.uk/" target="_blank">Ewan Clayton</a>  wrote our words on a document (pictured in part above) which everybody signed. And Rosie Miles, our poet-in-residence, wrote this poem  as she sat among  the congregation on the day.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words I give to you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say I want to make a life with you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will be the best that I can find:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will be fit to purpose,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will make love happen,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will include,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will speak of your God who is my God,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will be words we can both indwell,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will dance with desire and delight,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will be all the colours of the rainbow,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will be full of children and chaos and tulips and purple and lilac splendour.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words I give to you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say I want to make a life with you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will be the very best:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are all I have,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are all I am;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are my words,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is my heart.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jo-Inds-roadshow-Fifty-Shades-of-Gold.jpg" rel="lightbox[1431]"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1565" src="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jo-Inds-roadshow-Fifty-Shades-of-Gold.jpg" width="450" height="452" srcset="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jo-Inds-roadshow-Fifty-Shades-of-Gold.jpg 607w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jo-Inds-roadshow-Fifty-Shades-of-Gold-150x150.jpg 150w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jo-Inds-roadshow-Fifty-Shades-of-Gold-300x300.jpg 300w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jo-Inds-roadshow-Fifty-Shades-of-Gold-88x88.jpg 88w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jo-Inds-roadshow-Fifty-Shades-of-Gold-508x511.jpg 508w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>Midlife can be a time of loss, grief and anxiety about identity, greying hair and creaky knees.  It can also be an invitation to find a new way of being, one that is richer, deeper and more gleamingly radiant than what has gone before.</p>
<p>To celebrate being fifty, I made a Fifty Shades of Gold booklet, pictured above, exploring this journey, which I gave to my friends. I made a Fifty Shades of Gold website too.</p>
<p>Now I have been invited to speak on Fifty Shades of Gold at two beautiful venues in Birmingham. I&#8217;d be delighted if you would  join me.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Birmingham Cathedral, </span></strong><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Thursday, 13 March:  5.30 for 6pm</span></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.leverarts.com/section64402.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake Lever</a>&#8216;s awesome work, The Blue and the Dim and the Gold will be on display in Birmingham Cathedral from 28 February to 11 April. In the evening on Thursday, 13 March I will use this installation as a source for reflection on midlife, spirituality and change. The talk will include time for quiet and discussion.  You get to see the work in all its awesome glory and have the chance to ask questions.  It&#8217;s Fifty Shades of Gold in the flesh &#8211; well, in the paint and gold, in the case of the artwork.</p>
<p><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> £4</p>
<p><strong>Booking:</strong> recommended but not necessary &#8211; 0121 262 1840 or enquiries@birminghamcathedral.com</p>
<p><strong>Google maps:</strong> <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Birmingham,+West+Midlands+B3+2QB/@52.4811087,-1.8989949,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4870bc8e9c7d5dc7:0xfd7cbd4b70069273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Birmingham Cathedral</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Winterbourne House &amp; Garden, Tuesday 18 March:</b> <strong>12.30-1.30pm</strong></h2>
<p>I am delighted to be speaking at the gem that is <a href="http://www.winterbourne.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winterbourne House &amp; Garden</a> as part of Birmingham University&#8217;s Arts &amp; Science Festival, in partnership with <a href="http://www.writingwestmidlands.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Writing West Midlands</a>.  Jake&#8217;s work will be at the Cathedral so I will be showing it in a different way &#8211; using digital images showing detail that can sometimes be missed. I&#8217;ll be using poetry and Jungian literature to explore the golden years euphemistically known as middle age. This will probably be a bit more literary and a bit less quiety than then gig at Birmingham Cathedral.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Entrance fee:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> free</span></p>
<p><strong>Booking:</strong>  recommended but not necessary &#8211; <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="mailto:artsandscience@contacts.bham.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artsandscience@contacts.bham.ac.uk</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a grief that runs all the way through motherhood.</p>
<p>The grief in going up to the loft to exchange the 0-3 month old baby-grows for the 3-6 month ones, the grief of withdrawing the breast and saying: &#8220;No more,&#8221; the grief of a child&#8217;s first day in school.<span id="more-920"></span></p>
<p>It is widely accepted that many parents need to grieve when their children leave home. &#8220;Why wait til then?&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>I have wept over a boy becoming so bonny and chunky he has to be moved from his Moses basket into a cot, over him becoming so independent he no longer finds it necessary to curl my thumb within his hand.</p>
<p>I am grateful to a friend who gave me this poem when I was puzzling over why something as good and natural as a child growing up should also be so poignant.</p>
<p>It  is the kind of question that only a poet can answer.  What better answer than this could there be? <strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zx8fbk7/revision/8" target="_blank">Walking Away</a></strong> by C D-Lewis.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a poem that has kept me steady in the shaking of living with Multiple Sclerosis too.<span id="more-899"></span></p>
<p>For copyright reasons I can&#8217;t quote it all, but there is a line that brings strength as I come to terms with leading a life that is slower than I would wish: <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43333" target="_blank">I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy The Waking by <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/theodore-roethke" target="_blank">Theodore Roethke</a>.</p>
<p>Go slowly, friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d love to take the credit for this poem but I can&#8217;t. My only credit is knowing the utterly brilliant Rosie Miles. Fans of <a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/" target="_blank">Greenbelt Festival</a>, read and enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>If heaven (2)</strong><span id="more-556"></span></p>
<p>If heaven might happen</p>
<p>it would look like a racecourse</p>
<p>full of people not horses.</p>
<p>Everyone would have a place to pitch their tent</p>
<p>and there would be lots of mud and weather.</p>
<p>We would all be the same as before</p>
<p>except our bladder functions would have dried up.</p>
<p>There would be a place</p>
<p>on the top floor of heaven</p>
<p>to be very quiet.</p>
<p>There would also be skateboarding,</p>
<p>bands playing underground where the average age is fourteen,</p>
<p>a smörgåsbord of stalls to get food.</p>
<p>The programme of What Is On In Heaven</p>
<p>would be very full.</p>
<p>There would be a soundtrack of eternal drumming.</p>
<p>The Big Drummer would slow the rhythm</p>
<p>so everyone could get the beat.</p>
<p>You would be able to sit in one corner of heaven</p>
<p>and watch the amazing wide sky.</p>
<p>In another you could listen to a man</p>
<p>speak clearly of how he fought for human rights</p>
<p>when he was alive.  You could hear</p>
<p>a politician, a priest, a poet, a shy stuttering actor,</p>
<p>a Dominican monk, a cultural commentator.</p>
<p>You could wonder what would have happened</p>
<p>&#8212; what might still happen &#8212;</p>
<p>if Jesus had come as a girl.</p>
<p>You could learn to jive or tango</p>
<p>(step, two, three, four).</p>
<p>You could do none of these things.</p>
<p>You could sit on the steps of heaven’s grandstand</p>
<p>and play monster Connect 4 with the friends</p>
<p>who helped you pitch your tent,</p>
<p>watching all the people wearing wellingtons</p>
<p>imprinted with smarties or jelly beans.</p>
<p>Ten-foot transvestite angels would waft past</p>
<p>blowing bubbles of ambient music.</p>
<p>Strangers would smile at you</p>
<p>and people would have brought their dogs.</p>
<p>There would be a Big Top and jugglers on monocycles</p>
<p>and all the people on the doors of heaven’s venues</p>
<p>checking that you were wearing heaven’s wristband</p>
<p>would be unfailingly cheerful.</p>
<p>You would marvel at their ability</p>
<p>to herd an impossible number of people</p>
<p>into a finite space.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who signal to others the end of the queue.</p>
<p>In heaven they shall be the salt of the earth.</p>
<p>And you would belong there – really belong there –</p>
<p>because heaven would not be about</p>
<p>keeping your doubt out</p>
<p>or your many questions.</p>
<p>In fact, if heaven might happen there will be</p>
<p>no certainty at all</p>
<p>just a community of the wounded</p>
<p>who are as lost as you are</p>
<p>eating churros dipped in chocolate</p>
<p>trying to sing</p>
<p>the intelligence of the heart.</p>

<p>The night after my  mother died<br />
I lay in fear.<br />
I am a child in a supermarket<br />
Terrified<br />
Searching for my mum<br />
Between the aisles.</p>
<p>There she is.</p>
<p>In the sleepless dark<br />
I toss between the faith<br />
She would never abandon me<br />
And her breathless body<br />
Growing cold<br />
In my hands.</p>
