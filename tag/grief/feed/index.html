<p>One day I shall look back at this time</p>
<p>At the waiting</p>
<p>And the counting</p>
<p>And the bleeding</p>
<p>And the longing</p>
<p>The trying</p>
<p>And the not-trying</p>
<p>The loving</p>
<p>And forgiving</p>
<p>And I will say that it made sense.</p>
<p>I know the time will come again</p>
<p>When my womb will be holding</p>
<p>The secret hope,</p>
<p>The possibility of miracle,</p>
<p>Origins so awesome</p>
<p>That only God can know.</p>
<p>But today my vulva</p>
<p>Is tender-lipped</p>
<p>Heralding blood.</p>
<p>And today is the day</p>
<p>I have to live</p>
<p>Right now</p>
<p>Learning to embrace</p>
<p>My own body and grieving dreams</p>
<p>With the fierce</p>
<p>Unconditional</p>
<p>Over-whelming</p>
<p>Mother’s love</p>
<p>That is present</p>
<p>That is ready</p>
<p>That is now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are  seven reasons why I have been just lovin&#8217; this soggy summer.</p>
<p>1) The knowledge that the reservoirs have been re-stocked and the ground is rich and moist makes me feel safe and replete.<span id="more-936"></span></p>
<p>2) In the fleeting moments when the sun DOES shine, the grass is all the more verdant, the colours deliciously intense.</p>
<p>3) I can&#8217;t run at the moment because &#8211; seven months on &#8211; I&#8217;m still recovering from an injury.  The rain makes this a tiny bit less frustrating.</p>
<p>4) Due to that same running injury, there is only one pair of shoes I can wear at this point in time &#8211; and those shoes require socks. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s chilly.</p>
<p>5) I had vowed to make progress in my garden this summer but &#8211; as ever &#8211; haven&#8217;t had time. I feel all this rain kinda lets me off that one.</p>
<p>6) Sports Day was cancelled.</p>
<p>7) I am at a stage in life when I feel sad and full of grief.  The rain has made me feel that the world is weeping with me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a grief that runs all the way through motherhood.</p>
<p>The grief in going up to the loft to exchange the 0-3 month old baby-grows for the 3-6 month ones, the grief of withdrawing the breast and saying: &#8220;No more,&#8221; the grief of a child&#8217;s first day in school.<span id="more-920"></span></p>
<p>It is widely accepted that many parents need to grieve when their children leave home. &#8220;Why wait til then?&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>I have wept over a boy becoming so bonny and chunky he has to be moved from his Moses basket into a cot, over him becoming so independent he no longer finds it necessary to curl my thumb within his hand.</p>
<p>I am grateful to a friend who gave me this poem when I was puzzling over why something as good and natural as a child growing up should also be so poignant.</p>
<p>It  is the kind of question that only a poet can answer.  What better answer than this could there be? <strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zx8fbk7/revision/8" target="_blank">Walking Away</a></strong> by C D-Lewis.</p>
