These include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>low self-esteem as a result of the condition causing withdrawal from others<\/li>\n<li>experiencing stigma or discrimination<\/li>\n<li>having an anxiety or phobia that makes it difficult to leave the house<\/li>\n<li>taking medication that causes shaking or slurred speech which is misunderstood<\/li>\n<li>losing a job and the self-esteem and sense of belonging that can go with it<\/li>\n<li>behaving aggressively because of the condition which can strain relationships.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Social causes of poor mental health<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>While anybody of any social class or background can develop a mental health condition, we also know that poor mental health is related to factors such as poor transport, neighbourhood disorganisation and racial discrimination<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an element of shame to do with mental health \u2013 one\u2019s sense of self-worth is reduced. People don\u2019t want to spend time with you.\u201d (Bill, who has had depression.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Wealth inequality is another factor. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organisation<\/a> has found that unequal societies, such as Britain, have more pronounced levels of mental health problems than more equal ones<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This is true at a local level too. Dr Dave Furze, has researched what happens where neighbourhoods at the bottom of the UK Index of Multiple Deprivation are in close proximity to those in the top two per cent<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]<\/a>.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s increased stigma and isolation and there\u2019s often an associated lack of hope,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people see those nearby living in big houses and driving fast cars, they feel there\u2019s no way out and they just sort of accept it &#8211; unless there is some kind of catalyst for community development.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Combatting the loneliness that causes and is caused by mental health conditions is not just about dealing with individuals, however, important that is.\u00a0 It also demands paying attention to the inequalities that lead to poor housing, poor transport and unequal community services and facilities. The church is well placed to be a presence in areas where there is need for friendly spaces through which people can belong.<\/p>\n<h3>People with mental health conditions say what they need to feel less alone<\/h3>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cGardening. Being able to plant things and watch things grow, especially if this is done with other people.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe existence of people of good will who want to understand what it\u2019s like for someone else and who can get them to reach a level of relationship that\u2019s right for them.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cHaving somewhere to go, that\u2019s near with friendly people. When you have a mental health condition, there\u2019s a fence that goes round you.\u00a0 You can very easily get into the habit of getting isolated and never leaving the house. It happens so quickly.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]<\/a> Singleton N, Bumpstead R, O\u2019Brien M, Lee A, Meltzer H, Psychiatric Morbidity Among Adults Living In Private\u00a0Households, 2000 London: The Stationery Office p77, (2001)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\">[2]<\/a> Prevention Of Mental Disorders Geneva: World Health Organisation p29, (2004)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\">[3]<\/a> Buckinghamshire Sure Start Partnership: Deprivation Amongst Affluence (2000)<\/p>\n<p><em>This is the second of a <a href=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/loneliness-accident-or-injustice\/\" target=\"_blank\">series of posts on loneliness<\/a>.
