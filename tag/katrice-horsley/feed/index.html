										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three of my favourite things will be coming together on Wednesday, 25 February 2015.</p>
<p>First of all the treasure trove which is the <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/" target="_blank">Oxfam</a> Bookshop on Kings Heath High Street, Birmingham will be celebrating its refurbishment.  Still cosy, still welcoming, it will be enjoying a brand new look.<span id="more-1760"></span></p>
<p>Secondly, that treasure trove which is Katrice Horsley will be there telling tales in a way that only a national storytelling laureate can.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the theme of the morning will be <a title="How has being a mother affected my creativity?" href="https://joind.co.uk/mother-creativity/" target="_blank">motherhood and creativity</a> (one of my top topics) &#8211; and I shall be there discussing it with Katrice and you too, if you would care to come along.</p>
<p>Do you see motherhood as the ultimate creative act &#8211; or something that makes it impossible to get on with your own creative work? What&#8217;s the difference between raising a child and making art?</p>
<p>We will be telling stories, reading texts and sharing anecdotes on the theme of motherhood and creation at 11am to mark the re-opening of the Oxfam store.</p>
<p>Anyone is welcome but please note the event is for adults rather than children.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motherhood and Creativity with Jo Ind and Katrice Horsley is on Wednesday 25 February 2015 at 11am at the Oxfam Bookshop, 110A Kings Heath High Street B14 7LG.</strong></li>
</ul>
