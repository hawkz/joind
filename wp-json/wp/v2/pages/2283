This is always more challenging than simply doing a talk as it has the potential to touch participants at a deeper level. I use a variety of media &#8211; paints, collage, nature &#8211; and engage the senses of scent and sound.<\/p>\n<p>I have devised and delivered workshops on sexuality for the Diocese of Birmingham, the Diocese of Oxford, the Diocese of Exeter, the Centre for the Study of Christianity and Sexuality, Changing Attitude and The Clergy Consultation.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;We were excited, nurtured, and challenged to new depths of understanding by this remarkably gifted, warm and courageous young woman. &#8216;How can I grow?

They make a newspaper together and in the process\u00a0develop media awareness and a new sense of purpose in their writing.<\/p>\n<p>I have worked in both primary and secondary schools independently and through Write On!, a writers in schools programme administered by <a href=\"http:\/\/writingwestmidlands.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Writing West Midlands<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201cThank you for teaching me.
