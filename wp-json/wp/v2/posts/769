They are well organised. \u00a0I have time to practice and my brief is clear.<\/p>\n<p>Other times \u2013 and I enjoy these more, if I\u2019m honest \u2013 I\u2019m waiting for the hearses to arrive before I can find out what tune they want to what hymn and what I should do with this rock band that has turned up unannounced and set up in the corner.<\/p>\n<h3>I am humbled to be taking part<\/h3>\n<p>But whatever kind of funeral it is &#8211; black or white, peaceful or tragic, smooth or veering on the chaotic &#8211; I always feel profoundly humbled to be taking part.<\/p>\n<p>What can you say to people who are bereaved? \u00a0Not a lot.\u00a0 Words lose their currency in the rawness of grief.<\/p>\n<p>But music&#8230;.quietly playing as families hold cold hands and kiss their beloved\u2019s face before the coffin lid is\u00a0 closed&#8230;offering suggestions of amazing grace, hints of heaven\u2019s morning breaking&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>I am so honoured.
