<p>It IS a library.  It still is unique amongst UK libraries for the depth and range of its collections, six of which have been designated &#8220;outstanding&#8221; by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council.  You will still be able to go in to look something up or borrow a book.</p>
<p>BUT, as well as being a place for books, it is also a garden, a recording studio, a theatre, a concert hall, a board room, a coffee shop, a viewing point. (I would have taken photos of all of those things to show you, but the garden&#8217;s the only thing that&#8217;s ready at the moment.)</p>
<p>Architect Francine Houben calls it the &#8220;people&#8217;s palace.&#8221; I like that description but it doesn&#8217;t quite work for me because I don&#8217;t know what one does in a palace, except walk quietly down the corridors and be on one&#8217;s best behaviour.</p>
<p>I prefer to think of it as the &#8220;people&#8217;s playground&#8221; &#8211; a place where you arrive and think : &#8220;Oooh, look we could play pirates over there.   Or shall we go down here and pretend to be hobbits? But I want to play on the swings first.  Hey, look!  Let&#8217;s make a den over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Library of Birmingham is opening soon. Palace of playground, get ready for something you have never experienced before.</p>
