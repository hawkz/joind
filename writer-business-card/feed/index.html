					<description><![CDATA[Communicator sounds entirely accurate to me and very understandable. But yes, putting &quot;Simon Gray - communicator&quot; on a business card would seem a bit obtuse.
What about artist? That&#039;s what a communicator is. Could you put &quot;multi-media artist&quot; on your business cards?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Who am I and What do I do? have been difficult questions for me to answer for a long time! On my twitter and facebook bio I fudge it by just saying &#039;I make noises, pictures, words, websites, and enamelled things&#039; - I started off as a composer and performer of music (after spending 10 years studying and teaching at Birmingham Conservatoire), decided I wanted to be a journalist as I was moving out of working in music and did the city &#038; guilds courses, and shortly after that ended up getting a job as a web developer; now although I still work &#039;on teh interwebs&#039;, I&#039;m not really a *developer* anymore (having been passed by in the technology department), I&#039;m more strategy / management. And for the last year I&#039;ve been making jewellery as well!

So basically what I am is a &lt;strong&gt;communicator&lt;/strong&gt; - and I communicate in multiple media. Sounds a bit pretentious, I know, but I can&#039;t think of a better self-description of what I do!]]></description>
