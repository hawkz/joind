The simple pleasure of having an idea, meeting someone and then writing it up is one of which I never tire. As celebrity interviewer I have met Betty Boothroyd, when she was Speaker of the House of Commons, Moazzam Begg, who was held in Guantanamo Bay for three years without charge, and the then Aston Villa manager Ron Atkinson, who agreed to talk to me for more than hour without mentioning the f-word &#8211; football.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Thank you more than words can say for your article on Bhai Sahib Bhai Mohinder Singh Ji.

I am still touched by the young woman who fled a violent marriage in Iran and arrived in Birmingham in the back of a lorry. I will not forget the mother who was woken in the night by police saying her daughter had been murdered in her bed.<\/p>\n<p>In 2005 I was runner-up for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.equalityhumanrights.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Commission for Racial Equality<\/a>&#8216;s Race in the Media award for my &#8220;outstanding contribution&#8221; to\u00a0 race relations through my journalism.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;I just wanted to thank you for the wonderful Martin Bell interview.
