I use those moments to strategise: &#8216;If Arch is going to Oscar&#8217;s party on Saturday, I&#8217;ve got to buy a present. The only window I\u00a0 have for doing that is before work on Monday, which means I won&#8217;t be able to go to the gym, which means I&#8217;ll have to go on Sunday night, which means I can&#8217;t take him to see Sheila.&#8217;<\/p>\n<h3>Backlog in the brain<\/h3>\n<p>All the time this is going on, some part of my brain is building up a backlog or things I would like to reflect upon &#8211; how has being a mum affected my feminism? If giving birth is both so horrific and so natural what does that say about the nature of nature? If my brain is no longer what it was, does that mean I am no longer the person I was or is there more to me than my cognitive functions?<\/p>\n<p>I feel as though I&#8217;m living on borrowed thinking. It&#8217;s as though I&#8217;m using Internet Explorer 6 and keep seeing the prompts to update my browser but don&#8217;t have time to press the button.<\/p>\n<p>Can you be a feminist if you can&#8217;t think? That&#8217;s one to add to my list.
