										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I had the following conversation with a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Friend:</strong> Are you coming on the coach-trip to Blackpool?</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: No.  I didn&#8217;t fancy it with Arch. He hates being strapped in a seat. Making him sit still for three hours there and three hours back is something I&#8217;d rather avoid.<span id="more-800"></span></p>
<p><strong>Friend:</strong>  You should just tell him he has to sit still. That&#8217;s what I do with my little granddaughter. I could take her on a coach journey anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> So? Ebony is Ebony and Arch is Arch. That&#8217;s the difference.</p>
<h3>An all too familiar conversation</h3>
<p>How many times, in the five years since Arch has been born, have I had a variation on that conversation? (&#8220;My child does this. Your doesn&#8217;t.  Therefore you should change your parenting.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The assumption underlying it is that children are pretty much the same so they&#8217;ll all respond in a similar way to similar treatment.</p>
<h3>Adults are different &#8211; why shouldn&#8217;t children be?</h3>
<p>But where does that assumption come from? It&#8217;s certainly not true of adults.</p>
<p>Some adults needs to sleep for eight  hours a night, others thrive on four.  Some adults are at their best in a creative environment when they can make it up as they go along, other prefer to operate where there are clear rules and procedures. Some adults enjoy getting up early on a cold winter&#8217;s morning to run around a rugby pitch (they do honestly), others prefer to sit in bed and watch a film in Italian for the sheer sensuality of the words.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry. This is so obvious I&#8217;ve embarrassed myself writing it down.</p>
<p>My question is this:  If we accept this is true for adults, why should it be any different for children?</p>
<h3>The role of parenting</h3>
<p>Do I think that parenting has any bearing on the way a child behaves? Yes.</p>
<p>Would children behave in a similar way in the they were all brought up the same? Definitely not &#8211; and thank God for that.</p>
<p>You know what they say about <a href="http://www.quoteland.com/author/American-Indian-Proverb-Quotes/129/" target="_blank">criticism and moccasins</a>?  How much more true is it of parents and their gloriously varied offspring?</p>
