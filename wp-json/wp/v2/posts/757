One of the many things I enjoy about living in England is its climate and the contrast between its winter nights and summer days.<\/p>\n<p>But as the year is poised on this, the summer solstice, I salute and welcome the start of the hemisphere&#8217;s descent into darkness, \u00a0just as, in six months&#8217; time, I will welcome its ascent into light.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know that feeling of relief around 21 December, when from now on, the evenings are going to get lighter? \u00a0Today I have a similar feeling as the nights start to draw in.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2689,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[8],"tags":[88,179,180,186],"class_list":["post-757","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-prayer","tag-frustration","tag-solitude","tag-solstice","tag-summer"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/757"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=757"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/757\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2688,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/757\/revisions\/2688"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2689"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=757"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=757"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=757"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
