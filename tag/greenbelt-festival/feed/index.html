										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">I get heartily sick of the challenge of raising a family being characterised in terms of work-life balance.</p>
<p>Who thought of that phrase?<span id="more-534"></span></p>
<p>It makes it sound as though the only things we need are to earn a living and spend time with our families.  The implication is that so long as we&#8217;ve risen to the  challenge of getting work and childcare covered, we&#8217;re sorted.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ve got news &#8211; we&#8217;re not.</p>
<h3>I need solitude</h3>
<p>I have another need and that need is for <a href="https://joind.co.uk/no-solitude-like-home/" target="_blank">solitude</a>.  I&#8217;ll say it again, but louder: &#8220;SOLITUDE.&#8221;</p>
<p>I need time to be alone/pray/write. (I use forward slashes rather than commas because I&#8217;m not sure if they are different things.)</p>
<p>It is that need for solitude that too often goes unrecognised and therefore gets squeezed and therefore needs naming in capital letters.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I agreed to give a talk on revelation, identity and social media at the <a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/" target="_blank">Greenbelt Festival</a>. I rashly took this on in January when I had just taken redundancy and therefore anticipated I might be twiddling my thumbs around the August Bank Holiday (ho, ho).</p>
<h3>What  difference three days makes</h3>
<p>As a result I have  had to clear the time (three whole days so far) to be by myself and do a bit of reading and thinking and praying and writing &#8211; whatever name you give to what I do in my study.</p>
<p>Do you know? It has made me feel so good&#8230;. I was able to pay attention to random thoughts that had surfaced and been left hanging around like odd socks for far too many years.  I felt peaceful, deeper, &#8216;gathered-in.&#8217;</p>
<p>I must do this more often. I WILL do it more often. Prayer/writing/solitude might not get named in &#8220;having it all&#8221; features in glossy magazines but I&#8217;m naming it and I&#8217;m doing it now.</p>
