										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the conversations I have at the school gates, on football touchlines or in cricket pavilions are really conversations about identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think we’re talking about the 11+ or goalies or whether it’s better to learn classical piano or bass guitar &#8211; but what we’re actually talking about is who with think we are.</span><span id="more-3136"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the great challenges of parenting is the invitation it offers to continually reassess your identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you’re someone who has always considered herself to be a nice person. Taking care of people’s feelings and helping them feel good is what you do and who you are and what you always have been&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;and then you have a daughter whose brain is wired in a way that means empathy does not come naturally to her. She tends to blurt out exactly what she thinks and isn’t able to understand that it’s hurtful, not to say shocking, to be on the receiving end of her comments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One reason why this situation is difficult for the mum is that it challenges her identity. Can she continue to think of herself as an empathetic person when she has a daughter who isn’t?  How can she have faith and confidence in her daughter, as a mother surely needs to do, when her own sense of self is built on her belief that she doesn’t hurt other people &#8211; and that matters?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A father who is passionate about rugby might have a similar difficulty if he has a son who hates sport and who feels &#8211; and looks &#8211; clumsy in his body. If the dad has developed his own sense of masculinity through being a flanker on the rugby pitch, his son challenges him to recognise there are other ways of being a man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time and time again, I find being a parent causes me to question the ideas I have about myself. Did I really take such pride in getting full marks in spelling tests?  Is my identity rooted in something as flimsy as that?  It would seem that is. Why else do I feel uneasy if my child doesn’t do the same?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all emerge into adulthood with stories that we tell ourselves about who we are &#8211; clever, middle-class, well-liked, sporty, funny, musical, whatever&#8230;.  And these stories are important. They give us confidence and a way of navigating the world of work into which we thrust our adult selves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if we have kids who aren’t well-liked or sporty or whatever our particular thing is, it raises a question. How would we have survived without that story from which our identity was formed?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a deep question. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s what we’re all exploring as we chatter away about whether what school our child is going to, whether our daughter is gifted and talented, whether our son has special needs..</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend &#8211; Sunday, 9 June 2013 &#8211; I will be talking about sexuality at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/holygroundexeter/posts/469545393130447" target="_blank">Holy Ground</a> at Exeter Cathedral.</p>
<p>In preparing my talk, I&#8217;ve noticed that I have felt in a very quiet place around sexuality issues in recent years and found it almost unbearable listening to debates about the <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/marriagesamesexcouplesbill.html" target="_blank">Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill</a> currently going through Parliament.<span id="more-1039"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m not political.  Sexuality is a very political issue affected by the laws of the land that need changing, so some people have got to argue about it. There was a time when I would have been quite happy to be one of those people. Indeed I would have wanted it.</p>
<p>But now when those same arguments are being rehearsed over and over again in the The Mail,  The Sun, on Newsnight, on the Today programme, I find myself wincing and covering my ears (or eyes, depending&#8230;)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to shout about it.  I don&#8217;t want to argue about it &#8211; though I CAN. I just want to metaphorically take off my shoes and recognise that when we are talking about sexuality, we are indeed on holy ground.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So far, I have spent almost seven years trying to come to terms with <a href="https://joind.co.uk/why-i-remember-childbirth/" target="_blank">my experience of giving birth</a>.  I was beginning to wonder if I ever would, and then I read this, by psychologist Daniel Stern (pictured), who assured me that I wouldn&#8217;t.<span id="more-1019"></span></p>
<p>I am enormously grateful to have my experience articulated so very accurately.  (And it&#8217;s interesting that it was a man who did this for me.)  I would like to share it as Mother&#8217;s Day approaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;After many years of talking with women about their motherhood experiences, it is clear to me that almost without exception, the birth of her baby (especially her first one) is a central event in a woman&#8217;s life, in equal parts miraculous and traumatic, packed with unforgettable emotions and implications.</p>
<p>&#8220;For most women it is an event so primitive and profound as to be difficult to fully assimilate or put into words. It is a story that never gets fully told, not even to the mother herself, and therefore remains a partly-known unmovable cornerstone in the construction of her life story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether the birth experience was good or bad or a mix of the two doesn&#8217;t matter.  The memory remains vivid, no matter what.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Birth-Mother-Motherhood-Experience/dp/0465015670" target="_blank">The Birth of a Mother &#8211; How the Motherhood Experience Changes You Forever</a> by Daniel Stern</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I announced in my last post that I&#8217;d got a <a href="https://joind.co.uk/nhs-business-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new business card</a>  &#8211; deputy site editor of NHS local &#8211; I made a mistake.</p>
<p>Do you know that feeling of having told a half-truth? It&#8217;s not about telling a lie. It&#8217;s about settling for less than the truth deserves, neglecting to tell the most important part of a story.<span id="more-517"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card.jpg" rel="lightbox[517]"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1681 size-medium" src="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card-300x165.jpg" alt="Jo Ind's business cards" width="300" height="165" srcset="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card-300x165.jpg 300w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card-508x280.jpg 508w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The truth &#8211; the full truth &#8211; is that many months before I had an NHS local business card, I had another one beautifully designed by lower case design, which said: &#8220;Jo Ind &#8211; Writer&#8221; on it.</p>
<p>When I left the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birmingham Post</a> and <a href="https://joind.co.uk/quitting-birmingham-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became self-employed earlier this year</a>, I was asking myself who I am and what I do.</p>
<p>I could have tried to sell myself as a journalist, editor, teacher, manager, consultant, social-media-thingy because I am all of those things but it seemed to me that what I am, at heart, is a writer. Everything else I do comes out of that.</p>
<p>That was the simple  &#8211; and deeply truthful &#8211; message that I put on my business cards.</p>
<p>But for some reason I didn&#8217;t share that at the time. I shared my position at <a href="http://www.mavericktv.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maverick TV </a>instead.</p>
<p>Well, I am deputy site editor with NHS local and do you know what? I thoroughly enjoy it.</p>
<p>But before that I was a writer. And when I am old and grey (perhaps I should say older and greyer) I will still be writer.</p>
<p>That is what I am and that is what I need to say.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>(Clearly I&#8217;m not a photographer. But I&#8217;m getting Photoshop next week, so I hope to learn how to improve the images on my blog very soon.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love my new boss.  I like her ideals, her approach to life, her attitude to business. They echo my own.</p>
<p>I know she has my best interests at heart &#8211; as I do hers. It&#8217;s not uncommon, even in the best of organisations, to feel a degree of ambivalence towards your employers.  You are prepared to work hard and put yourself out, but, quite rightly, there are limits as to how far you will go on their behalf.<span id="more-333"></span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t feel like that towards my new boss. I would go to the ends of the earth for her and her family. She has my complete, unconditional support.</p>
<p>I love being self-employed. It rocks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>See this woman. I&#8217;ve just found out that she is my great great great great grandmother.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, as part of a feature I was writing for The Birmingham Post, I went with family historian Paul Wilkins to Birmingham Central Library to trace my family tree and discovered, amongst other great worthiness, that I am a direct descendant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Fry">Elizabeth Fry</a>, the woman who reformed prisons in the nineteenth century and is commemorated on the back of a fiver.<span id="more-109"></span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3087" src="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Elizabeth-Fry-Five-Pound-Note.jpg" alt="" width="795" height="408" srcset="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Elizabeth-Fry-Five-Pound-Note.jpg 795w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Elizabeth-Fry-Five-Pound-Note-300x154.jpg 300w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Elizabeth-Fry-Five-Pound-Note-768x394.jpg 768w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Elizabeth-Fry-Five-Pound-Note-700x359.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m trying to work out how it makes me feel.</p>
<div id="more">
<p>To be honest, it wasn&#8217;t a total revelation. I was told this as a child but I had completely forgotten it as it hadn&#8217;t been mentioned since. This is the first time I have seriously tried to take it in.</p>
<p>The news broke on same day that Trinity Mirror announced it was looking to axe between 60 and 80 posts in the Midlands, which means that my job, along with those of my fellow journalists, is seriously under threat.</p>
<p>But did I care? No, not that day because my great great great great grandmother was Elizabeth Fry and if she could reform the prison service, then I was damn sure I could work out how to support my family even if I didn&#8217;t have a job in the depth of a recession. You can&#8217;t touch me Trinity Mirror, I&#8217;m made of noble, worthy, heroic, pioneering, life-transforming stuff!</p>
<p>And then the next day I felt stumped because it was raining and I couldn&#8217;t work out how to dry the washing&#8230;</p>
<p>At a practical level, knowing I have descended from a long line of do-gooders (we will be revealing more in the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/">Post</a> over the next few weeks) makes no difference at all. The difference is at the level of imagination and identity.</p>
<p>But even there, my relationship to the news is complex.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I am glowing &#8211; radiating the light from the halos of my ancestors. On the other, I know that I am who I am, regardless of who has gone before me. When I meet people, I want to know them for who they are, not for who their families might or might not be &#8211; and that includes myself.</p>
<p>I am very glad to be getting to know my ancestors but I am also very glad I lived for 45 years before I did. I&#8217;m glad I was established as a professional feminist before I knew my great great great great grandmother founded the first national women&#8217;s organisation. I&#8217;m glad I had inquired about working as a writer in residence in prisons before I was aware I am a direct descendant of a prison reformer.</p>
<p>My first reaction to the news is to tell people &#8211; have a good old brag. But once it is integrated into my understanding of myself, I think it is something I will want to keep quiet. I will get photographs of the amazing women who have gone before me. I will keep them at home and when life is challenging, I will sit in their presence and silently draw from their strength.</p>
