When we put something down in words, we have to use the fine motor movements of the brain. We haven\u2019t really understood something until we have written it down. \u00a0Thinking that deeply and clearly is a process we tend to avoid because it&#8217;s difficult\u00a0\u2013 I know I do anyway.<\/p>\n<h3>A writer is a changer<\/h3>\n<p>Writing is not a neutral activity.\u00a0 It changes things. Listening to people is powerful. Analysing and synthesising a situation through writing it down causes\u00a0people to understand it \u2013 and therefore experience it \u2013 in a new way.\u00a0 That can be transformative.<\/p>\n<h3>So what is a writer?<\/h3>\n<p>A writer is a listener, a thinker and a transformer of people and situations. \u00a0But I can&#8217;t say all that, when people ask me, can I?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When people ask what I do for a living, I tend to say I&#8217;m a writer. \u00a0Maybe I should think of a different answer, because too often people imagine my work involves sitting at home all day coming up with inspiration.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2870,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[12],"tags":[236,237,204],"class_list":["post-1812","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-writing","tag-journalist","tag-transformation","tag-writer"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1812"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1812"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1812\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2874,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1812\/revisions\/2874"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2870"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1812"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1812"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1812"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
