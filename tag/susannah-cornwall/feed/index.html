										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to have contributed a chapter to <a href="http://www.dltbooks.com/titles/2007-9780232530674-sexuality-the-inclusive-church-resource" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sexuality &#8211; The Inclusive Church Resource</a>, which is due to be launched in Birmingham in February 2015.<span id="more-1508"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sexuality-the-inclusive-church-resource-book-cover.jpg" rel="lightbox[1508]"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2842 alignleft" src="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sexuality-the-inclusive-church-resource-book-cover.jpg" alt="Front cover of Sexuality by Susannah Cornwall" width="400" height="647" srcset="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sexuality-the-inclusive-church-resource-book-cover.jpg 400w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sexuality-the-inclusive-church-resource-book-cover-185x300.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><a href="http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/theology/staff/cornwall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Susannah Cornwall</a>, who wrote the theology section of the book, is a woman after my heart and mind on sexuality.</p>
<p>She says the church tends to think that sexuality issues are about homosexuality because it constructs homosexuality as &#8220;other&#8221;.</p>
<p>One things that follows from that is that heterosexuality is often unmarked, it&#8217;s just something in the water that people barely notice or comment on because they take it for granted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sexuality isn’t just to do with orientation it’s broader than that,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>I do so agree.  Much of my own work, has been around finding a way of conceptualising sexuality so that we can all sit down and listen and weave our theology together.</p>
<p>I hope some of us will be doing that at the Birmingham launch of the book. Everyone is welcome on Tuesday, 24 February 2015 at 7.30pm at Balsall Heath Church Centre, 100 Mary Street, Balsall Heath B12 9JU</p>
<p>The event is hosted by the Birmingham branch of Changing Attitude.</p>
<p>The book is part of a <a href="http://www.darton-longman-todd.co.uk/titles/2054-inclusive-church-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series published by Darton Longmann and Todd</a> which aims to make the church more inclusive on matters such as mental health, disability, sexuality, poverty, gender and ethnicity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.inclusive-church.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inclusive Church</a> is an organisation founded in 2003, initially because of concern at the <a href="http://www.christiantoday.com/article/jeffrey.john.could.become.church.of.england.bishop/40657.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resignation of Revd Dr Jeffrey John as Bishop of Reading</a>, but thereafter because it wanted to work towards a church that is welcoming and open to all.</p>
