										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The good news for those who’ve struggled to strike a work-life balance is that you’re let off.  Work-life balance is so turn-of-the-millennium (darling). Work-life integration is the must-have of the teeny decade.<span id="more-1503"></span></p>
<p>It was six years ago the Chartered Management Institute produced a report  Management Futures – The World in 2018 which claimed that rather than balancing work and home demands, by 2018 we will be weaving the two together.</p>
<p>More recently Mashable has been asking if <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/10/04/work-life-integration/" target="_blank">work-life integration is the new norm</a> and Harvard Business Review has considered <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/09/what-successful-work-and-_n_5958920.html" target="_blank">what successful work-life integration looks like</a>.</p>
<h3>Work-life integration</h3>
<p>To me work-life integration looks like doing my supermarket shopping in five minutes while waiting for a meeting at work to begin. It’s picking up an email from the office while standing in the school playground. It’s saying to a colleague: “Let me share this document with you so you can work on it tomorrow at home.”</p>
<p>It means the boundaries between my paid work and the rest of my life are less rigid than they were before Google was a map, a calendar, a filing system, a note book and an address book as well as a store, a video channel and a search engine.</p>
<p>Where I once restricted work to work, I can now nip into work while watching telly, lounging by a hotel pool or crawling through a tunnel in a soft play centre.</p>
<h3>Do I want my work and life to be integrated?</h3>
<p>I CAN do these things.  But is it a good thing to do?  Do I want to? For me the answer is about the extent to which the integration is within my control.</p>
<p>For the most part Google and its suite of tools have greatly enhanced my life.  Being able to glance at work emails when I’m not in the office makes working part-time considerably easier. I don’t have to respond to emails if I don’t want to, but I can pick up on important things, if do.</p>
<p>And because I am only ever a click away, I can leave the office to see my son star as Joseph in his school nativity play or care for him when he is ill.  It’s a win-win situation.  Everyone gains.</p>
<h3>Google calendar makes it possible</h3>
<p>Apart from the capability of picking up emails anywhere, the tool I find most useful in leading an integrated life is Google calendar.</p>
<p>I remember the days, not so long ago, when, if I was trying to organise a get-together with a friend, she had to go home to look at her calendar before we could arrange anything.  She and her husband kept a calendar in their kitchen, so they could see what the other was doing. This was fine – unless she was at work, in the pub or anywhere else when she needed to make an arrangement. How she needed Google calendar!</p>
<p>I now have a Google calendar for home and one for work. I have one for my husband and one for my son and I can access the calendars of whoever gives me permission in the office.</p>
<p>This functionality is invaluable to anyone who aspires to lead an integrated life. If I need to arrange a doctor’s appointment, I can click into my work calendar, my home calendar and my son’s to find a space when all are free. And I can do this wherever I am &#8211; from my phone, from the office or from my desk top computer at home.</p>
<h3>I can turn the calendars off</h3>
<p>But the real beauty of Google calendar is that I can turn the calendars off.  I don’t share my home calendar with anyone outside the family. And when I’m at home or on holiday, I can tag a box which means my work calendar is not longer in my view.</p>
<p>Sometimes I need to see my personal and professional arrangements together. Sometime I want to separate the two.  The beauty of Google calendar is that I can integrate or not, depending on what my needs are at the time.</p>
<p>Google calendar is not just a tool for work-life integration.  It’s a metaphor for it too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">I get heartily sick of the challenge of raising a family being characterised in terms of work-life balance.</p>
<p>Who thought of that phrase?<span id="more-534"></span></p>
<p>It makes it sound as though the only things we need are to earn a living and spend time with our families.  The implication is that so long as we&#8217;ve risen to the  challenge of getting work and childcare covered, we&#8217;re sorted.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ve got news &#8211; we&#8217;re not.</p>
<h3>I need solitude</h3>
<p>I have another need and that need is for <a href="https://joind.co.uk/no-solitude-like-home/" target="_blank">solitude</a>.  I&#8217;ll say it again, but louder: &#8220;SOLITUDE.&#8221;</p>
<p>I need time to be alone/pray/write. (I use forward slashes rather than commas because I&#8217;m not sure if they are different things.)</p>
<p>It is that need for solitude that too often goes unrecognised and therefore gets squeezed and therefore needs naming in capital letters.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I agreed to give a talk on revelation, identity and social media at the <a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/" target="_blank">Greenbelt Festival</a>. I rashly took this on in January when I had just taken redundancy and therefore anticipated I might be twiddling my thumbs around the August Bank Holiday (ho, ho).</p>
<h3>What  difference three days makes</h3>
<p>As a result I have  had to clear the time (three whole days so far) to be by myself and do a bit of reading and thinking and praying and writing &#8211; whatever name you give to what I do in my study.</p>
<p>Do you know? It has made me feel so good&#8230;. I was able to pay attention to random thoughts that had surfaced and been left hanging around like odd socks for far too many years.  I felt peaceful, deeper, &#8216;gathered-in.&#8217;</p>
<p>I must do this more often. I WILL do it more often. Prayer/writing/solitude might not get named in &#8220;having it all&#8221; features in glossy magazines but I&#8217;m naming it and I&#8217;m doing it now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I announced in my last post that I&#8217;d got a <a href="https://joind.co.uk/nhs-business-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new business card</a>  &#8211; deputy site editor of NHS local &#8211; I made a mistake.</p>
<p>Do you know that feeling of having told a half-truth? It&#8217;s not about telling a lie. It&#8217;s about settling for less than the truth deserves, neglecting to tell the most important part of a story.<span id="more-517"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card.jpg" rel="lightbox[517]"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1681 size-medium" src="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card-300x165.jpg" alt="Jo Ind's business cards" width="300" height="165" srcset="https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card-300x165.jpg 300w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card-508x280.jpg 508w, https://joind.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/I-take-it-back-new-business-card.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The truth &#8211; the full truth &#8211; is that many months before I had an NHS local business card, I had another one beautifully designed by lower case design, which said: &#8220;Jo Ind &#8211; Writer&#8221; on it.</p>
<p>When I left the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birmingham Post</a> and <a href="https://joind.co.uk/quitting-birmingham-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became self-employed earlier this year</a>, I was asking myself who I am and what I do.</p>
<p>I could have tried to sell myself as a journalist, editor, teacher, manager, consultant, social-media-thingy because I am all of those things but it seemed to me that what I am, at heart, is a writer. Everything else I do comes out of that.</p>
<p>That was the simple  &#8211; and deeply truthful &#8211; message that I put on my business cards.</p>
<p>But for some reason I didn&#8217;t share that at the time. I shared my position at <a href="http://www.mavericktv.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maverick TV </a>instead.</p>
<p>Well, I am deputy site editor with NHS local and do you know what? I thoroughly enjoy it.</p>
<p>But before that I was a writer. And when I am old and grey (perhaps I should say older and greyer) I will still be writer.</p>
<p>That is what I am and that is what I need to say.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>(Clearly I&#8217;m not a photographer. But I&#8217;m getting Photoshop next week, so I hope to learn how to improve the images on my blog very soon.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t hate the public relations industry and I certainly don&#8217;t hate people who work in it. Some of my best friends&#8230;..(<a href="http://www.jaynehowarth.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Jayne Howarth</a>, Ros Dodd etc). Unlike some journalists I actually feel grateful to good PR firms. Let&#8217;s be honest, in recent years working on a newspaper would have been far harder without them.<span id="more-403"></span></p>
<h3>What I hate is doing PR. That&#8217;s all.</h3>
<p>I feel the need to say this because since I&#8217;ve been a self-employed writer, at least once a week I get a call from somone I&#8217;ve featured in the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/" target="_blank">Birmingham Post</a> in the past, who wants me to write about them again. They suppose that now I&#8217;m freelance I&#8217;m only to happy to tout my work round a range of publications and, they imagine, earn a multiple fee from them.</p>
<p>To which I can only say that I would sooner pickle my head. In fact I DID say exactly that to one hopeful &#8211; he still didn&#8217;t understand I didn&#8217;t want the job.</p>
<p>For those that don&#8217;t understand the difference let me explain. It&#8217;s about the difference between telling and selling. I love the telling. I&#8217;m a writer. I like to communicate, to connect, to build up relationships. I loathe the selling &#8211; picking up a phone and saying: &#8216;I&#8217;ve got a great story here. Do you want to publish it?&#8217;</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not in PR. It&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not in double-glazing.</h3>
<p>Granted, there is middleground between telling and selling, a place where sales-patter and headline-writing sit. I&#8217;m comfortable on one side of that middleground, I&#8217;m not on the other.</p>
<p>Next time I&#8217;m approached by someone who wants me to both tell and sell their story, I shall put analogies about pickling heads to one side. I shall simply say: &#8216;The service you require is public relations. £1,500 would be the going commerical rate.&#8217; Let&#8217;s see if that works.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love my new boss.  I like her ideals, her approach to life, her attitude to business. They echo my own.</p>
<p>I know she has my best interests at heart &#8211; as I do hers. It&#8217;s not uncommon, even in the best of organisations, to feel a degree of ambivalence towards your employers.  You are prepared to work hard and put yourself out, but, quite rightly, there are limits as to how far you will go on their behalf.<span id="more-333"></span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t feel like that towards my new boss. I would go to the ends of the earth for her and her family. She has my complete, unconditional support.</p>
<p>I love being self-employed. It rocks.</p>
