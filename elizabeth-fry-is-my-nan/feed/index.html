					<description><![CDATA[Hello cousin! That&#039;s really good to hear. It does feel good to have an ancestral connection as you put it and makes me feel more aware of the ancestors that I don&#039;t know anything about but which are there nonetheless.  Yes, I guess it is harder to find out more if you are in Australia.  My obstacle is time. All my family tree tracing has had to be put on hold because life is too busy. One day in 20 years, maybe.... Thanks for getting in touch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jo.  I have been told by my mother since I was little that I too am a direct descendant of Elizabeth Fry through her Mother&#039;s side,  Not sure how many &quot;Greats&quot; but probably about the same as you.  I have no idea of my family tree other than this and being in Australia it is probably a bit too difficult to sort out.  However, when visiting the UK I travelled to see the Quaker museum and tapestry to find out more about her. It gave me very much a sense of ancestral &quot;connection&quot; and although as with you I know I am, who I am, because of my own experiences and values, it is kind of nice to know that some of those values started generations before me.]]></description>
