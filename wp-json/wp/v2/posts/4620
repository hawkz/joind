I started out writing books. I was aged 21, straight from university when I wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Fat-Spiritual-Issue-My-Journey\/dp\/026467295X\">Fat is a Spiritual Issue<\/a>, followed a decade later by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Memories-Bliss-God-Sex-Us\/dp\/033402885X\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3A3R7I3D8LPFL&amp;keywords=memories+of+bliss&amp;qid=1650308873&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=memories+of+bliss%2Cstripbooks%2C88&amp;sr=1-1\">Memories of Bliss<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With both books, I remember the point at which I sent them off to their publishers, a point at which nobody else had read them in their entirety apart from me. Writing books was a solitary activity. I discussed the content with others, but nobody read what I had written, commented on it or steered me along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In writing, there was an intimacy between me and the page. It was a place through which I grafted and despaired and became. When I finally got to the point where I could say: \u201cSo THAT\u2019s what I needed to write,\u201d it was as much of a surprise to me as it was to anyone else. The great river of creativity had carried me to a place that had been hidden even from me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having done that twice, the day came when a publisher said: \u201cWhat do you want to write next? I don\u2019t mind what it is. Tell us what you want to write and we\u2019ll publish it.\u201d It was an enviable offer by any standards and yet, for reasons that alluded me at the time, I found myself thinking: \u201cNah\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, I can say I stopped writing books.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings me to today and Our Garden \u2013 Sacred Spaces of Balsall Heath. Unlike my books, which were written entirely by me, this is a project I couldn\u2019t possibly do by myself. And that is the very thing that touches me. I go out of the room to make tea and when I come back the artists are talking about the nature map and making it their own. The project manager is forming relationships in ways that I couldn\u2019t. The <a href=\"https:\/\/chamberlainhighburytrust.co.uk\/\">Chamberlain Highbury Trust<\/a> gives us fruit trees. The mosques are inviting us to Iftars I hadn\u2019t imagined. It\u2019s humbling. It fills me with gratitude. It\u2019s where I want to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, I am working on <a href=\"https:\/\/unboxed2022.uk\/\">UNBOXED: Creativity in the UK<\/a>, a celebration of creativity taking place in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales during the summer of 2022.&nbsp; In the interests of simplicity, it calls itself a celebration of creativity, but it\u2019s actually a particular kind of creativity that it\u2019s celebrating &#8211; not personal self-expression but creative collaboration.&nbsp; It\u2019s about what happens when you bring together people form science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics; what happens when you bring established organisations together with emerging artists. It\u2019s about <em>our c<\/em>reativity and its power to change the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am excited by this because this is the kind of creativity I want to experience in my life right now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Am I saying that I will never write a book again? Of course not. Anything might happen.&nbsp; I can only go with the flow of the river of creativity and be surprised at where it takes me. I\u2019m not into goals, aims and predictions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I AM saying that, when I was in young, I was very concerned with the question of what I was doing with my life. It was a question that had an urgency that drove me. Today it&#8217;s not even a question that interests me. \u201cWhat are we doing together?\u201d That&#8217;s the question that drives me now.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s creative collaboration rather than self-expression that interests me now.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4631,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3,254,12],"tags":[57,179,181,205],"class_list":["post-4620","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-community","category-green","category-writing","tag-creativity","tag-solitude","tag-soul","tag-writing"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4620"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4620"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4620\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4644,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4620\/revisions\/4644"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4631"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4620"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4620"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4620"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
