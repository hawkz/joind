					<description><![CDATA[Oh yes, I hear you. I do see my family in small dozes. I stopped doing the family Christmas thing a few years ago (my parents have long passed). Christmas is too important to me, I spend December seeing all my family and friends but come Christmas eve, I&#039;m on a plane heading somewhere where I can do whatever I want!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is it not possible to at once love your family and be independent of them?  I can&#039;t wait to go home for Xmas with mine and hope one day that my little one will feel the same - a healthy distance between us, but plenty of time spent together...  If the answer is no, then drink plenty of mulled wine to get you through!]]></description>
