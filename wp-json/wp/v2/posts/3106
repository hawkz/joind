I saw I had no cash and realised my mistake.<\/p>\n<p>You can probably guess, from the headline, the outcome of this story. \u00a0I returned to the bank and asked if anyone had handed in the money. \u00a0Someone had. \u00a0Can you believe it? I was given my fifty pounds.<\/p>\n<p>I was very, very surprised. \u00a0This was Kings Heath High Street after all.<\/p>\n<p>And I was delighted &#8211; delighted to have my money back, of course, and very delighted by that act of honesty and kindness from someone I will probably never meet and never be able to thank.<\/p>\n<p>This random act of kindness kept me happy all day, for many days actually. \u00a0Whenever I recalled it, I felt hopeful. It was a tiny act but, because it was close, it dwarfed Brexit, Trump and all the other things that sometimes make me miserable.<\/p>\n<p>We have more personal power than we suppose. We really can engender in each other feelings of warmth and hope and gratitude.<\/p>\n<p>And stranger. \u00a0Whoever you are, whether you are my brother, my sister, my older, my younger. Thank you. Thank you for handing in my fifty pounds at the NatWest Bank. Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Something happened on Kings Heath High Street that made me feel good all day. \u00a0Whenever I remembered it, I smiled. \u00a0If I felt a bit low, I just had to recall that thing and I felt happy again. \u00a0And again. \u00a0And again.
