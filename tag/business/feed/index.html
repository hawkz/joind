										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to be team lead at Google&#8217;s Digital Garage in the Library of Birmingham, which offers free digital tune-ups to small businesses.<span id="more-1898"></span></p>
<p>Small businesses, start-ups and charities can book in for one-to-one mentoring sessions with Digital Garage technicians who will help improve their website, their social media presence, the way they use Adwords and much, much more.</p>
<p>The two training seminars are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tell your story online</strong> &#8211; creating a good website, making it mobile-friendly, using insights gained from data to improve your site and using social media to boost your digital presence</li>
<li><strong>Reach new customers online</strong> &#8211; understanding how search works, being more findable in both regular (organic) and paid search</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s all free, but it won&#8217;t be there for ever.   The Garage will pop up for a few months in the Library of Birmingham and then pop up in another city, so get your Google goodies while you can.</p>
<ul>
<li>Register for Free Training at the Birmingham Garage</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love my new boss.  I like her ideals, her approach to life, her attitude to business. They echo my own.</p>
<p>I know she has my best interests at heart &#8211; as I do hers. It&#8217;s not uncommon, even in the best of organisations, to feel a degree of ambivalence towards your employers.  You are prepared to work hard and put yourself out, but, quite rightly, there are limits as to how far you will go on their behalf.<span id="more-333"></span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t feel like that towards my new boss. I would go to the ends of the earth for her and her family. She has my complete, unconditional support.</p>
<p>I love being self-employed. It rocks.</p>
