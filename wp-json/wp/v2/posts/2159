My name is Jo Ind and I\u2019m the introverts\u2019 cruise director. I\u2019d like to welcome you on board this vessel for a vacation we hope will be awesome, in the true sense of the word.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing an introvert needs to understand when boarding a ship with more than 3,000 other people, is that there\u2019s always a place where you can be alone. Even while hundreds of passengers are at the Mega Deck Party doing the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wZv62ShoStY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cha Cha Slide<\/a>, you can still find a quiet spot where all you can hear is the hum of the engine and the sounds of the ocean. Wander around the ship and find yours.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h3>Arrivals and sailaways<\/h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, take note of the information that can be found in small print on the front of the daily news sheet &#8211; the times of the ship\u2019s expected arrival in port and its sailaway. If the ship is due to arrive at 7am, set your alarm for 6am and head for the bow. There you will find a handful of your fellow introverts sharing a moment of exquisite beauty &#8211; the ship sliding slowly into harbour just as the sun is rising. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These arrivals are what cruising is for. They are gentle, majestic, silent and different with each new morning and each new port. Please don\u2019t miss them.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h3>Kids&#8217; Club<\/h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have children with you, let them try out the onboard kids\u2019 club. If you do, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll make friends with children their own age from all over the world. \u00a0Once that happens you won\u2019t see them between breakfast and one o\u2019clock the following morning. This leaves adults free to do adult things &#8211; such as reading. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re visiting a different Caribbean island each day, there\u2019s plenty to read about. Obviously, you can\u2019t get to know another country well in the space of eight hours, but if you read about its history before you visit, you can use the snippet of time well enough to get a good taste. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h3>Onshore<\/h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each island has a different topography and a different response to a colonial past. When you get onshore, walk round, take a taxi, ask questions, chat to people who live there and notice the subtle changes in prosperity, etiquette, language and outlook. Gather literature from museums, cathedrals and fortresses. \u00a0Go to your quiet spot when back on board. Sip a pina colada, gaze at the sea and digest what you have learnt about the peoples with whom you have spent your day.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h3>Fun Day at Sea<\/h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Travelling in this way is so intense and sensuous, you\u2019ll be glad to have a Fun Day at Sea. \u00a0This is a day when the shop doesn\u2019t dock, you are surrounded by water and the extroverts play things like Hit the Jackpot and a Larger than Life Game Show. Go back to your quiet spot and notice the blueness &#8211; the ocean, the sky and the nothing in between. \u00a0Here the horizon curves, the water rolls and the starless heavens are a bright, bright dome. \u00a0Spend time here. Know the circling roundness of it all. \u00a0Live this moment. Take it home. Go back at night and be enveloped in darkness. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h3>Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you<\/h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you cruise like this, you are likely to become deeply happy. \u00a0The depth of the ocean, the slow movement in the sea, the vastness of the sky, the volcanoes, the waterfalls, the sand, the faces, the stories, the welcomes\u2026. They might well put\u00a0you in the mood for dancing. Go on. Go to where the<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0DJ&#8217;s playing: \u00a0\u201c<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d. \u00a0Dance the night away with the best of them.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Casinos, karaoke, making the deck of the ship throb with the lights and sounds of Ibiza&#8230;this was some of the \u201cfun\u201d promised to guests setting out on a Caribbean cruise by Carnival Cruise Director Felipe Curato this week.\u00a0If I hadn\u2019t known any better, I would have disembarked straightaway.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2160,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[6,8],"tags":[248,251,249,250,179,181],"class_list":["post-2159","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-philosophy","category-prayer","tag-cruise","tag-felipe-curato","tag-holiday","tag-introvert","tag-solitude","tag-soul"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2159"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2159"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2159\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3431,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2159\/revisions\/3431"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2160"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2159"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2159"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2159"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
