I was shown to three desks, two waiting areas and one clinical space. At each point, people smiled. There was welcome, clarity and a quiet seriousness about it all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt humbled and grateful. I was humbled by the scale of the horror that had brought us all to this place; by the skill of the scientists; by the dedication of healthcare staff; by the urgency of the roll-out programme. I was in my home city, but I felt connected to the globe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This little jab was one small step towards saving lives, giving children their education and healing the world. Some people had their jabs in cathedrals. Millennium Point was cathedral for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-tiled-gallery aligncenter is-style-rectangular\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__gallery\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__row\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"1244\" data-id=\"4258\" data-link=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/covid-19-vaccination-centre-millennium-point-jo-ind-2\/\" data-url=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Covid-19-vaccination-centre-millennium-point-jo-ind-2-scaled.jpg\" data-width=\"2560\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Covid-19-vaccination-centre-millennium-point-jo-ind-2-scaled.jpg?ssl=1\" layout=\"responsive\"\/><\/figure><\/div><\/div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__row\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\" style=\"flex-basis:67.32205524820736%\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"1140\" data-id=\"4259\" data-link=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/covid-19-vaccination-centre-millennium-point-jo-ind-3\/\" data-url=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Covid-19-vaccination-centre-millennium-point-jo-ind-3.jpg\" data-width=\"1628\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Covid-19-vaccination-centre-millennium-point-jo-ind-3.jpg?ssl=1\" layout=\"responsive\"\/><\/figure><\/div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\" style=\"flex-basis:32.67794475179264%\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"772\" data-id=\"4260\" data-link=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/covid-19-vaccination-centre-millennium-point-jo-ind-4\/\" data-url=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Covid-19-vaccination-centre-millennium-point-jo-ind-4.jpg\" data-width=\"989\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Covid-19-vaccination-centre-millennium-point-jo-ind-4.jpg?ssl=1\" layout=\"responsive\"\/><\/figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"1668\" data-id=\"4261\" data-link=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/covid-19-vaccination-centre-millennium-point-jo-ind-5\/\" data-url=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Covid-19-vaccination-centre-millennium-point-jo-ind-5-scaled.jpg\" data-width=\"2560\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Covid-19-vaccination-centre-millennium-point-jo-ind-5-scaled.jpg?ssl=1\" layout=\"responsive\"\/><\/figure><\/div><\/div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__row\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"1960\" data-id=\"4262\" data-link=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/covid-19-vaccination-sticker-jo-ind-1\/\" data-url=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Covid-19-vaccination-sticker-jo-ind-1.jpg\" data-width=\"2076\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Covid-19-vaccination-sticker-jo-ind-1.jpg?ssl=1\" layout=\"responsive\"\/><\/figure><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I found it strangely moving having my Covid-19 vaccination at Birmingham&#8217;s Millennium Point this morning.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4268,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3,8],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-4254","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-community","category-prayer"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4254"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4254"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4254\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4627,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4254\/revisions\/4627"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4268"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4254"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4254"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4254"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
