										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Spirituality is when the inside of things is bigger than the outside” &#8211; Richard Rohr.</p>
<p>I came across that quote while I was taking a look at the new website of  <a href="http://www.saint-saviour.org/">St Saviour&#8217;s, Bridge of Allan</a> where my brother is rector.<span id="more-704"></span></p>
<p>It just happened to catch my eye because I was about to write a post on why I was finding it hard to post at the moment.</p>
<h3>Why it&#8217;s sometimes hard to write a blog post</h3>
<p>There are many times in life when I find my inner world more vivid and enticing than the outer world: I can&#8217;t read on the bus because I want to stare out of the window, I&#8217;m late for an appointment because I have been day-dreaming in the bath, I don&#8217;t switch the telly on because lying on my back looking at the ceiling is far more entertaining than anything being offered to me on a screen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going through a time like this at the moment &#8211; a time when I am being beckoned by my soul rather than wooed through the web. The outer world is small and thin. My inner world is rich and deep.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is &#8220;spirituality.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know if this is the way of being to which Richard Rohr was alluding. But it is good to name this place and it a good place to be.</p>
