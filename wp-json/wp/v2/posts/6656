An organisation has reached its coming-of-age, when the vision of the people who set it up is so embedded, it can thrive and survive without them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew Christophers has written <em>Starting Up &amp; Scaling Up A Human-First Business, <\/em>as he steps back from Brand Genetics, the marketing consultancy he co-founded 25 years ago.&nbsp; He is essentially sharing his tips for success, rooted in the direct experience of growing a business from his kitchen table to one with a \u00a36.1m turnover (December 2021).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having read his book, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that Brand Genetics will flourish without him in a hands-on role &#8211; and that\u2019s the greatest compliment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew claims that Brand Genetics has achieved success through being a \u201chuman-first\u201d organisation. His book unpacks what this means, using photographs, real-life stories and a nice big font with summaries of key take-outs at the end of each chapter.&nbsp; (It is a marketing consultancy after all.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s distinctly lacking in pomposity and, with the slight exception of the section on Mutant Marketing, jargon-free. The book follows an A-to-Z structure, with insights appearing in alphabetical, rather logical, order. It essentially makes the book a selection of anecdotes, like pearls on a necklace. To me, this is a human-first, approach \u2013 presenting the nuggets as insights from a well-lived life rather than a thesis. Andrew says that Michael, one of his members of staff, used to joke about some of Brand Genetics work, saying: \u201cthat\u2019s all very well in practice, but what\u2019s the theory?\u201d Scrap the theory \u2013 that\u2019s what I say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a book about scaling up a start-up, but it resonated with my experience of working in charities, medium-sized businesses, and global corporations too. What he says about delegation and trusting younger people to do the work will be appreciated by micro-managed employees in organisations of every size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took strength from his JFDI section which was about the importance of making decisions.\u00a0 \u201cI once read that the best managers don\u2019t make better decisions, they just make more decisions,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Yes! Absolutely!\u00a0 I hereby take \u201cJust F***ing Do It\u201d as my modus operandi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most surprising tip came from his Never Stop section. I thought it a universal rule of business that you never have someone in the job at the time you need them.&nbsp; By the time you have identified the need, made the business case, signed off the job description, advertised the post, interviewed and waited for the new employee to hand in their notice, you are so busy doing the work yourself that you don\u2019t have time to induct the new employee into the role. Was it not ever thus? (Or is that just the way it works in the circles where I hang out?)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand Genetics has an interesting take on this. They try to hire good people BEFORE they need them, knowing they will need them one day. There\u2019s something I never thought of before\u2026 \u201cNever Stop selling, and never stop recruiting either,\u201d says Andrew.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most touching anecdote came in Y is for You, which was about being your true self at work. From the style of his book, it\u2019s easy to imagine that Andrew is a bit of an operator in business. He admits that he was good at putting on a suit and playing the game.  Who&#8217;s to say that his business wasn&#8217;t just like all the others &#8211; where the guys at the top deliver a nice patter about employee-care but are no different from anyone else in reality?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found myself believing that Brand Genetics really was a human-first business when Andrew admits that putting on a suit and playing the game came at a cost of being true to himself. He says he didn\u2019t want that. And he wanted everyone at Brand Genetics to be their true selves, warts and all. So one of his employees would come to work in shorts and bring his dog with him too \u2013 and they loved him for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, that heart-warming anecdote brought a distinct layer of authenticity to this beautifully presented and easily digestible book. I believe Brand Genetics really is a human-first business &#8211; and as such businesses of all sizes need to sit up and listen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve got a job going, have you?)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>Starting Up &amp; Scaling Up A Human-First Business<\/em> by Andrew Christophers is published by Troubador and costs \u00a312.99)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Book-Cover-2.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox[6656]\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"523\" src=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Book-Cover-2-700x523.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6661\" srcset=\"https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Book-Cover-2-700x523.jpeg 700w, https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Book-Cover-2-300x224.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Book-Cover-2-768x574.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Book-Cover-2-1536x1147.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Book-Cover-2-800x597.jpeg 800w, https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Book-Cover-2-1200x896.jpeg 1200w, https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Book-Cover-2-1400x1045.jpeg 1400w, https:\/\/joind.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Book-Cover-2.jpeg 1698w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s a sign of the success of a charity, community group or small business when it can outlive its founder members.
