										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling all Balsall Heath, Birmingham types.  Come along to the next Great Green Clothes swap at Balsall Heath Church Centre, Edward Road B12 9JU on Friday 23 April at 7pm. (People from Moseley and Kings Heath can be honorary Balsall Heathens for the evening. So can anyone else for that matter.)<span id="more-421"></span></p>
<p>I went to my first clothes swap, or &#8216;swish&#8217; to those in the know, last year and had not imagined it would be so much fun.</p>
<p>You pay a fiver to take your unwanted clothes along. You get given a ticket for each item you bring. You have a cup of tea and when the gong strikes, you all make a modest-but-mad rush to the rails to pick up any goodies that have caught your eye on the way in. You &#8216;pay&#8217; for them with your tickets.</p>
<p>The fun for me is seeing other people trying on your discarded clothes, looking great in them and going home feeling very happy. That was the unexpected bit &#8211; a pleasure you miss if you drop your clothes off at a charity shop.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great gig for girlies &#8211; all trying things on and giving each other tips and ideas &#8211; but last time the blokes enjoyed it too. See you there.</p>
