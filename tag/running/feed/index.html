										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are  seven reasons why I have been just lovin&#8217; this soggy summer.</p>
<p>1) The knowledge that the reservoirs have been re-stocked and the ground is rich and moist makes me feel safe and replete.<span id="more-936"></span></p>
<p>2) In the fleeting moments when the sun DOES shine, the grass is all the more verdant, the colours deliciously intense.</p>
<p>3) I can&#8217;t run at the moment because &#8211; seven months on &#8211; I&#8217;m still recovering from an injury.  The rain makes this a tiny bit less frustrating.</p>
<p>4) Due to that same running injury, there is only one pair of shoes I can wear at this point in time &#8211; and those shoes require socks. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s chilly.</p>
<p>5) I had vowed to make progress in my garden this summer but &#8211; as ever &#8211; haven&#8217;t had time. I feel all this rain kinda lets me off that one.</p>
<p>6) Sports Day was cancelled.</p>
<p>7) I am at a stage in life when I feel sad and full of grief.  The rain has made me feel that the world is weeping with me.</p>

<p>For copyright reasons I can&#8217;t quote it all, but there is a line that brings strength as I come to terms with leading a life that is slower than I would wish: <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43333" target="_blank">I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow</a>.</p>

<p>Go slowly, friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have had three personal trainers in the past five years &#8211; all young, all men and all so lean you would use a vat of olive oil should you ever need to fry them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve liked them all, and I&#8217;ve learnt different things from each.<span id="more-857"></span></p>
<p>But as I nurse a running injury I&#8217;m thinking about what I need in order to be able to run without doing as much harm as I do good.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s got me onto imagining what I really want my personal trainer to be.</p>
<p>My ideal personal trainer would be someone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaks the language of sleep and rest as eloquently as he talks of exertion</li>
<li>Understands that a woman&#8217;s strength waxes and wanes with the moon</li>
<li>Is as skilled in the fine art of listening to the body as he is in pushing it</li>
<li>Appreciates that a body in winter has different needs from a body in summer</li>
<li>Grasps that time spent exercising is time that would otherwise be spent earning money or being with the family and so needs to be kept in balance</li>
<li>Knows nothing in nature goes on getting fitter and stronger&#8230;but goes in cycles of fattening and leaning, of working and resting, of hurting and healing.</li>
</ul>
<div>Hmmm&#8230;.Looks like I&#8217;m going to have to do the job myself then.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why is a 5km run known as a <a href="http://www.bigfunrun.com/" target="_blank">fun run</a>? That is a question I used to ask myself as I sweated it out on the treadmill &#8211; panting, smelly and desperate to sit down after a mere 3km&#8217;s interval training.</p>
<p>A 5km run is said to be for families and beginners. But despite years of working out at the gym, I would feel defeated after running little more than half that distance. &#8220;How do other people do it?&#8221; I wondered. &#8220;I can&#8217;t carry on any more&#8230;&#8221;<span id="more-717"></span></p>
<h3>It all changed last Saturday</h3>
<p>That was until last Saturday, when it was such a glorious spring morning I decided that instead of working out in the gym, I&#8217;d go for a jog around <a href="https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/kingsheathpark" target="_blank">Kings Heath Park</a>.</p>
<p>I had already found out that a figure of eight in Kings Heath Park is 2km, so I decided to do one and a half circuits and call that my workout for the day.</p>
<p>I started off. The frost on the grass was glistening like pearls in the low-morning sunshine. The bare trees stood in sculptural silouettes against the clear blue sky.   Tiny varieties of daffodils and snowdrops were peeping shyly from the earth.  The birds were calling to each other, reminding me of other dawns I had witnessed, other times when I am overwhelmed by the sheer sensuality of being alive. I completed one lap.</p>
<h3>Praying on the second circuit</h3>
<p>On the second circuit, replete with voluptousness, I decided to pray. I remembered a baby I knew who was in hospital, for one loop of the eight.  I thought about the people of Japan, for the second.  Every time I glanced at the roofs of the Kings Heath terraced houses, I would think of the people who lived in them, whose names I didn&#8217;t know but whose neighbourhood I shared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just run 4km,&#8221; I realised as I finished the lap.  &#8220;How come I couldn&#8217;t run 4km on a treadmill? Isn&#8217;t that a great example of the connection between body and spirit? Doesn&#8217;t that just show the fallacy of thinking of the body as a fixed, physical entity?&#8221;</p>
<p>And with that, I thought I may as well do another 2km circuit &#8211; and I did.</p>
