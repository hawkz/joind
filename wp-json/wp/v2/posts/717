I completed one lap.<\/p>\n<h3>Praying on the second circuit<\/h3>\n<p>On the second circuit, replete with voluptousness, I decided to pray. I remembered a baby I knew who was in hospital, for one loop of the eight.\u00a0 I thought about the people of Japan, for the second.\u00a0 Every time I glanced at the roofs of the Kings Heath terraced houses, I would think of the people who lived in them, whose names I didn&#8217;t know but whose neighbourhood I shared.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just run 4km,&#8221; I realised as I finished the lap.\u00a0 &#8220;How come I couldn&#8217;t run 4km on a treadmill? Isn&#8217;t that a great example of the connection between body and spirit? Doesn&#8217;t that just show the fallacy of thinking of the body as a fixed, physical entity?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And with that, I thought I may as well do another 2km circuit &#8211; and I did.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why is a 5km run known as a fun run?
