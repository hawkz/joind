This is undoubtedly an issue. \u00a0But there is another dimension to that withdrawal. \u00a0How do we detach ourselves emotionally from our children in order to create? \u00a0(How do I put to one side Arch&#8217;s tears when I banish him from the room so that I can write?)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to hear from other mothers if their creativity has been affected through having a child. \u00a0Top tips on how to manage are always welcome.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I recently watched\u00a0Who Does She Think She Is? &#8211; an award-winning film by Pamela T Boll \u00a0about motherhood and creativity.
