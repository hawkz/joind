										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes the best things are those that we stumble upon.</p>
<p>It was never part of my plan to play the organ for funerals, but it just so happened that I became a church organist because I could play the piano and there was a vacancy on the organ stool.<span id="more-769"></span></p>
<p>And so it was that playing for funerals became part of the rhythm and texture of my life and has been for the past 20 or so years.</p>
<h3>Each funeral is different</h3>
<p>Some funerals are huge standing-room-only affairs – 400 people squashed into the space with not enough orders-of-service to go round and with trouble being heard at the back.  Others are pitifully small and lonely.</p>
<p>Sometimes the person who died is someone who has approached death without fear and who leaves an inspiring legacy to her mourners.<br />
Other times the coffin is shockingly small, carried by a mother and father in unbearably poignant steps.</p>
<p>Some families know exactly how they want the service to be conducted. They are well organised.  I have time to practice and my brief is clear.</p>
<p>Other times – and I enjoy these more, if I’m honest – I’m waiting for the hearses to arrive before I can find out what tune they want to what hymn and what I should do with this rock band that has turned up unannounced and set up in the corner.</p>
<h3>I am humbled to be taking part</h3>
<p>But whatever kind of funeral it is &#8211; black or white, peaceful or tragic, smooth or veering on the chaotic &#8211; I always feel profoundly humbled to be taking part.</p>
<p>What can you say to people who are bereaved?  Not a lot.  Words lose their currency in the rawness of grief.</p>
<p>But music&#8230;.quietly playing as families hold cold hands and kiss their beloved’s face before the coffin lid is  closed&#8230;offering suggestions of amazing grace, hints of heaven’s morning breaking&#8230;.</p>
<p>I am so honoured. It is one of the best things that I do.</p>
