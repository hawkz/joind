					<description><![CDATA[Jo, I have to say I&#039;ve fallen in love with your blog.  I&#039;m not sure how I actually got here..clicking from blog to blog until I somehow landed on yours.  As you say in your Why I Love Funerals Post &quot;Sometimes the best things are those that we stumble upon.&quot;

I chose to comment on this page because it hit home with me.  I&#039;ll be saying goodbye to my engineering job at the end of this year.  I hope I can do so with the same dignity and poise as you.

Please keep writing...the world needs your voice.]]></description>
